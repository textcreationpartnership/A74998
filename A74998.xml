            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His much Honoured And Dearly Beloved, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> IOHN GOODVVIN, And the Brethren of his Society.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here have now (Dearly Beloved) ſeveral yeares paſſed over our heads, ſince I first obtained that good opinion from you, as to be admitted into your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And ſure I am, I ſhall not flatter you in acknowledging, that if I have not in all this time improved my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate very much; it is not becauſe I have not had opportunity ſo to doe, but becauſe I have not had an heart fully to improve this opportunity. And how ever mine own dulneſſe and indiſpoſition, have obſtructed much of that increaſe which was (as I beleeve) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me on your part, yet this I must acknowledge to the praiſe of that rich and abundant grace of God that hath uttered it ſelfe among you, and hath been declared by you, that your love, diligence, faithfulneſſe, and zeale, and the grace of God in them, have made ſuch impreſſions upon me, as by which you may well (as I doubt not but you will) ſtand much indeared to me all my days.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Chriſtian reſpects I have received from you, they have ſo much exceeded what I could well expect, as
<pb facs="tcp:110914:3"/>that I have not been under any temptation of neglect this wayes, whereby the bond of my union with you could be looſened.</p>
            <p>And yet ſo it is (Beloved, as ye well know,) that ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and impreſſions of conſcience in me, have cauſed me in ſome things to differ from the moſt of you, and have occaſioned ſome alteration in my fermer practiſe and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with you; yet not without long conſideration, and ſome conſultation firſt had with many of you, in order to my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in that wherein I doe differ. But I truſt that the conſciences of thoſe who know my compliant temper, will be ready to witneſſe with me, that my differing from you does not proceed from a love in me to differ, but from my love to truth as apprehended by me; my inclination otherwiſe ſtrongly carrying me to a compliance with all men, how much more with you, when it may be without a breach making upon the peace of my conſcience.</p>
            <p>But ſince I have taken the liberty to diſſent from you, both in opinion and practice as to ſome things; I could not but hold my ſelfe obliged, to give you an account of ſome of the grounds upon which I have done it; which that I might doe upon better terms then otherwiſe I had convenient opportunity to doe, I have made this publick addreſſe to you as you ſee.</p>
            <p>And in as much as my intention herein, next unto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the truth it ſelfe, is to ſerve you; my hope is, that you will as ſeriouſly and impartially intend and weigh the import of the matter preſented to your view, as I have with ſincere reſpect unto your benefit prepared it.</p>
            <p>It is like the inconſiderableneſſe of the author, and the great improbability, that one far inferior in parts, and gifts, ſhould ſee further, and diſcerne more in things of this nature, then thoſe that much tranſcend him, will be a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon you, if not wholly to neglect and deſpiſe this piece of diſcourſe; yet to think it unworthy your ſerious thoughts.</p>
            <p>But I know, you know how to releeve your ſelves againſt this temptation, conſidering that it is no new thing for God,
<pb facs="tcp:110914:3"/>
               <hi>out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings to ordain ſtrength,</hi> as well as out of the mouths of ſtronger men: nor for him to put of his <hi>treaſure</hi> into <hi>earthen</hi> weak <hi>veſſels, that the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its power might be the better knowne to be of God:</hi> nor is it any thing more then ordinary, for him to ſubject the ſtronger to ſupplies from the weaker in ſome things; <hi>ſo that the head ſhall have no cauſe to ſay unto the feet. I have no need of you.</hi> Beſides, hath not the undue admiring of the learning, parts, and abilities, even of good men themſelves in their generations, as if they had been comprehenſive of all truth coming under their conſideration, when as they have been tainted with errour and ſuperſtition in ſome things, I ſay hath not this been a ſnare by which many have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in error and ſuperſtitious vanities, much longer then otherwiſe they would have been? men of the greateſt parts not being alwayes the forwardest nor foremoſt in all acts of reformation, they having more ſtrength to hold out againſt the truth, and a greater dexterity to obſcure it both from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, by pleas, objections and ſubtile diſtinctions or involutions rather,
<note n="*" place="margin">For how ever they ſometimes dîſtinguiſh and divide in things which are of an intire and collective in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, yet for the moſt part they err on the other hand, by involving and confounding things together, which are of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: and this they do in nothing more, then in jumbling together the Legal and Evangelical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, which differ almoſt as much as night and day.</note> then men of lower parts have.</p>
            <p>The nature of the ſubject alſo (here tendered to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) being ſuch, as tends to perſwade men to imbrace that deſpiſed way, which is generally <hi>every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> and which is apt to bring the aſſertors of it into dis-eſteeme and contempt among men, if not to expoſe them to ſufferings of a worſer nature, it may doubtleſſe be a temptation to many, not to be two inquiſitive after things of this nature, but to content themſelves, onely with a curſorie and ſuperficial ſurvey of them, leſt otherwiſe by a more intent and impartial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and a more narrow ſcrutinie into, and thorow exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of matters, they ſhould diſcover ſo much light, as by which they muſt be neceſſitated, eyther to hazard much of their outward honour, peace, and proſperity in the world in following that light, or their inward peace and tranquility in not obeying it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:110914:4"/>
            <p>But as concerning you my friends, who have deſpiſed this temptation in other caſes, which otherwiſe would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived you of ſome other great truths of the goſpel, with which you are now enriched; my hope is, that you will be the better prepared to reſiſt it at this turn alſo. For know ye for a certainty, that the conſcience never hath ſo rich a taſt of the ſweet and pleaſant fruit of righteouſneſſe, as when a man in conſcience to God, and love to truth, is willing to ſuffer, and doth ſuffer from the world in the practice of it: this <hi>hidden Manna is not taſted, ſave by thoſe that overcome</hi> temptation. But why ſhould not thoſe that are Godly wiſe indeed, overſhoote the devil in his owne bow? and rather be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to, then diſcouraged from ſearching into thoſe doctrines and waies, which are diſcountenanced by the world; ſince they are ſo much the likelier to be of God: <hi>for if they were of the world, the world would love her owne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo a thing very ungrateful to the fleſh, and hardly attained without much ſpiritual ingenuity, for men who have for a long time, and with great confidence, owned, aſſerted, and pleaded the cauſe of an erroneous way; afterwards to acknowledge their miſtakes, and turn Advocates for that, which with a high hand they have ſomtimes oppoſed.</p>
            <p>But he that knows not how to deny himſelf in ſuch things as theſe, upon conviction sof light; knows not how to approve himſelf a man worthy the name of a Diſciple of Chriſt; who, as the Maſter ſaith, <hi>cannot be ſuch, except he deny himſelf.</hi> And had not ye (Beloved) learned this ſpiritual art long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this in other caſes, you had never made ſo happy an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Error for Truth, as now I eſteem you to have done.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto been coming out of darkneſs, error, and ſuperſtition but by degrees, and not all at once, now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one error, and then another; and why then ſhould not our former experience this wiſe, admoniſh us ſtill of not being too confident of our having now diſcovered all Satanical, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and anti-chriſtian deceits, in doctrine and worſhip unto the bottome; but rather to be jealous over our own hearts
<pb facs="tcp:110914:4"/>and judgements, leſt ſome of thoſe old dregs ſhould yet be left behinde? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, that <hi>the path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day:</hi> and yet where would there be place and opportunity of growing in knowledge and underſtanding, if there were not occaſion even for Chriſtians themſelves, ever and anon to be changing their dark and crooked thoughts, for more lightſom and well rectified apprehenſions?</p>
            <p>It is a thing doubtleſſe too to incident alſo even to otherwiſe good men themſelves, not onely to put much of that affection they bear to the erroneous things they practiſe, into the ballance with the reaſons upon which they act; by which means that ſeems to them ponderous, which otherwiſe in it ſelfe is as light as vanity; but alſo to preſume and hope, that thoſe ſeeming grounds which they have, will excuſe them before God in their way and practiſe, though their confidence concerning them, ſuffers many a rebuke from the truth when it is laid cloſe to the conſcience by the Spirit of God. But the Spirit of truth, which loves and <hi>deſires truth in the inward parts;</hi> though he patiently bears and indures much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuitie of this kinde in the mindes of men for a time, yet if his applications for cure hereof be alwaies ſlighted and neglected, it many times provokes him at laſt to leave them under the power of their owne deceivings, and to ſay; <hi>But if any man be ignorant</hi> (viz. upon ſuch terms) <hi>let him be ignorant, 1. Cor. 14.38.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day is now hastening apace, wherein the mighty God will reckon with the Babiloniſh whore for corrupting the earth with her deceits; and then the eye of Jeſus Chriſt will be upon thoſe, who have thorowly pleaded his cauſe, wholly followed him, and faithfully born witneſſe to his truth againſt all her unſound and corrupt waies, <hi>to keep them from the hour of temptation that ſhall come upon all the world to try them,</hi> whereas thoſe that have been partakers with her in her corruptions, must then be partakers with her in her ſufferings, though otherwiſe they be the people of God themſelves, unleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:110914:5"/>they have before that time, obeyed that voice which ſaith, <hi>come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> And therefore how exceedingly doth it concern all thoſe who would be then found <hi>pure virgins indeed, and ſuch as have not defiled their garments,</hi> no not with any the leaſt of thoſe whoriſh polutions, narrowly to conſider ſuch their ways, which are ſhreudly ſuſpected for unclean, as they are whoſe nakedneſſe I have hereby laboured to diſcover.</p>
            <p>Thus having (though not without weakneſſe, yet) with much uprightneſſe and true affection to you, ſpread my thoughts and apprehenſions before you, as touching thoſe things wherein I cannot cloſe with you, (being nevertheleſſe not unwilling to retract any thing I have done, if ever the vanitie of it ſhall be diſcovered to me, as loving no way in Religion further then I apprehend it countenanced by the truth) and having herein ſatisfied my ſelf in diſcharge of my duty towards you, I ſhall now commend this poore endeavour of mine to the bleſſing of the bleſſed God, and you unto his direction in the peruſall of it, and ſhall God inabling me ſtill endeavour to approve my ſelfe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haſt in the following diſcourſe, together with ſome other things, ſome few of thoſe many arguments that are and may be readily produced againſt the practiſe of Infant Baptiſm: and ſuch they are for the moſt part as have not been inſiſted on by others; for I would not weary thee with the repetition of the ſame Arguments which are extant in other mens labours; for which cauſe their number is the leſſe: but thou wilt do well to eſtimate the truth in this particular, rather by the weightineſſe then number of the Arguments leavied for its ſervice.</p>
            <p>I would have thee take notice, that where ever thou meeteſt with any expreſſions tending to deny mens viſible being in Chriſt, or their viſible memberſhip in his Church without Baptiſm, ſuch deniall is ſtill intended in reſpect of Goſpell form and order, according to which men are not regularly viſibly incorporated into Chriſt or his Church without Baptiſm. The which holy order of the Goſpell, though I intend no more thereby, ought to be of ſacred reſentment to every Chriſtian, in as much as <hi>every word of God is pure,</hi> and ſavours of divine wiſdome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.5.</p>
            <p>But now as concerning the miſchievous effects of Infant Baptiſm, (not ſo much as to touch here upon thoſe which are diſcovered in the enſuing diſcourſe) I ſhall here onely hint at two or three of them, which might alſo have been drawn up more amply argument-wiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the untimely and undue adminiſtration of Baptiſm to Infants, hath doubtleſſe proved a miſerable ſnare to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb facs="tcp:110914:6"/>and ten thouſands in the world, to neglect that which ſhould have rendred them worthy the name of Chriſtians indeed, whileſt they have fancied themſelves to be ſuch, upon account of their Chriſtendome as they call it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which they received in their Infancy. For whereas they are made to beleeve that they have been Baptized into Chriſt, and thereby received into the number of Chriſts flock, and incorporated into his Church by that Baptiſm; they have hereupon preſumed themſelves good Chriſtians, and in ſafe condition, and have taken it ill that any ſhould make queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the contrary, though otherwiſe they have had little more then this upon which to build ſuch a confidence. Whereas otherwiſe, if they could not have attained ſo much as the name and repute of Chriſtians, much leſſe the hope of that ſalvation which belongs to Chriſtians indeed, without a manifeſtation of repentance and faith preceding their Baptiſm, and their reception of Baptiſm thereupon, which yet is the Goſpell way; there is no doubt but that millions of men and women would have quit themſelves upon far better tearms then now they have done, in labouring after knowledge in the Goſpell, and ſuch other qualifications as would have rendred them meet for Baptiſm, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for communion in other ordinances of the Goſpell, rather then they would have fallen ſhort of the confidence of being Chriſtians, and the repute of ſuch, and the hope of ſalvation which belongs to thoſe that are ſuch indeed. For mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream impatience of not being reputed Chriſtians indeed upon account of their Infant Baptiſm, and that ſlender and contradictory profeſſion which they make, argues the name and repute of ſuch, and that hope they have thereby, to be a thing ſo dear and precious to them, as that they would do much more then now they do for the gaining of it, if they had it not upon ſuch eaſie terms as now they have, as men have ordered the matter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> From what elſe then the practiſe of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, hath proceeded the Churching of whole Nations and Kingdomes; whileſt all Infants in a Nation (except ſuch as have been prevented by death) have been Baptized, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:110914:6"/>received into the Church? and if ſo, why may we not ſay, that the national Church officers the Biſhops, yea the univerſal Biſhop himſelf the Pope, have grown out of the ſame root? For if there had been no nationall Baptiſm in this kind (as doubtleſſe there would not, if Baptiſm had not been to be had but upon Scripture terms, <hi>viz.</hi> apparent repentance and faith preceding) then there would have been no nationall Churches, that being as to outward form the foundation upon which they are built, and door of entrance thereinto; and if there had been no nationall Churches, there could have been no nationall Church officers; and if no nationall Church officers, then ſurely no univerſall officer over all nationall both Churches and officers: So that Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may well be conceived to be the cauſe <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> that without which neither the one nor the other of theſe would have been as now they are. And therefore how ſmall a matter or innocent thing ſoever Infant Baptiſm ſeems to moſt, yet who may not ſee, if they will but ſeriouſly conſider it, that the evils and miſchiefes that have taken place in the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the taking place of nationall Churches and their Officers, and the head of them all the Pope, may in great part be charged upon that dangerous errour Infant Baptiſm, of which we ſpeake? And what a diſhonour and reproach hath it been to Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould be looked upon as head of ſuch Churches, and that ſuch vile and unworthy perſons ſhould be eſteemed members of his body, as thoſe nationall Churches and the perſons of whom they have moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted have been; as if Chriſt and Belial had been well agreed? Beſides, theſe Nationall, corrupt, indeed Antichriſtian Churches, have in great part thruſt out the true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, and his diſcipline, and the purity of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Ordinances, and have contempered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in conſtitution, diſcipline and worſhip unto the ſpirit of this world, by which they have for the moſt part been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and acted.</p>
            <p>And therefore however this After Baptiſm (as it is called) is charged with rending and tearing of Churches (which in true conſtruction is but a rending and dividing of perſons
<pb facs="tcp:110914:7"/>from Churches of an undue and humane conſtitution; that they might be gathered into the fold of Chriſts own making; and ſuch a diviſion as this the Goſpell hath always wrought in the world, in reſpect of ſome or other of its truths, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.51.) yet indeed and in truth it is not fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Baptizing of men after they beleeve, but Infant Baptiſm that is truely guilty of rending and tearing, indeed of diſſolving the true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt in the world.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the third place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> though thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall, or Independent Churches as they are called, have conceived with themſelves that they have provided well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſin of corrupting and carnalizing Churches, of which the Nationall and Parochiall aſſociations are guilty, by that ſeparation which they have made from them; yet upon due conſideration it will be found, that they have but only for the preſent lopt off ſome evill and corrupt branches, but have not at all taken away the root that bears them; for their practiſe of Baptizing their Infants, and thereupon imbodying them with themſelves, will within the ſpace and compaſſe of leſſe then an age (as is more then probable) render theſe Churches alſo, much-what as carnall as the Parochiall and Nationall are. For whatſoever children are whileſt but Infants, (during which time I cannot but hold their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition good and ſafe God-wards, the Scriptures favourable aſpect that wayes conſidered) yet when they come to years of diſcretion they ſo corrupt themſelves with actuall ſin, even the children of good men as well as bad, as that that ſaying of our Saviour muſt take place concerning them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God.</hi> And without controverſie, thoſe who in reaſon cannot on this account be judged in a capacity to ſee the Kingdome of God, cannot in reaſon be judged in a capacity to have communion with God, and with his Saints in all the ordinances of God. And whether it be not very rare for perſons to be as early in their repentance and faith, as in their actuall ſinning, which yet hath no promiſe of pardon without an actuall turning unto God; I leave to themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:110914:7"/>to conſider, whoſe experience and obſervation I doubt not will incline them to conclude it ſo to be. And therefore it cannot be (in all probability) but that ſuch Churches if they ſhould continue for the ſpace of an age in that way in which they now are, they muſt of neceſſity conſiſt in great part of carnall and unregenerate perſons, as the parochiall Churches do.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall conceive this a convenient remedy againſt this evill, <hi>viz.</hi> to Excommunicate children, or youth, about the time in which they come to know the difference between good and evill, at which time they make themſelves guilty of actuall tranſgreſſion, and conſequently put themſelves under a neceſſity of converſion, to wit, repentance and faith for the obtaining remiſſion of thoſe actuall ſins; and therefore in reaſon cannot be looked upon as regenerate, untill the fruites <hi>worthy amendment of life</hi> and of faith do appear: though this remedy I ſay ſhould be thought on, (which is not likely) yet for them to retain them in the Church whilſt Infants, and to caſt them out when they come to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is ſuch a thing which as there is no rule preſcribing it; ſo I beleeve (my own obſervation in ſome other caſes prompting me hereunto) it will prove a thing of greater difficulty then indulgent parentall members will know how to overcome.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall think to prevent this more then inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Baptizing Infants into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, and not receiving them into any particular Church till they can give an account of their repentance from dead workes, and faith towards God; or elſe if they do receive them into a particular Church, ſhall think to prevent this by not admitting them unto communion with the Church in other ordinances, till they can give the aforeſaid account; herein likewiſe (beſides the evill of unregenerate perſons permiſſive abode in the Church) they ſhall give a rule unto themſelves, which God hath not given. For whoever are fit to be, and <hi>de facto</hi> are members of the univerſall viſible Church, are fit alſo to be members of particular Churches; and whoſoever are members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="tcp:110914:8"/>Churches, cannot according to any rule in Scripture, that I know, be excluded part and fellowſhip in any the Ordinances there adminiſtred. For during the time in which God would have Infants to be members of the nationall Church of the Jews, and partakers of one ordinance, to wit, Circumciſion; he did neither order their excommunication out of the Church, upon account of their unregeneration when they became actuall ſinners; nor yet debarre them communion with the Church in any other ordinance, till ſignes of their regeneration appeared; nor were they exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded communion in any the ordinances of that Church at any time from their very Infancy, otherwiſe, or longer then the terms of naturall neceſſity and debility did impoſe it upon them.</p>
            <p>Nor does it at all follow, that Infants are to be admitted Church members under the Goſpell, becauſe they were ſo under the Law, as ſome vainly imagine; nor yet that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of like diſqualification may be admitted into, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Churches under the Goſpell, as might be both the one and the other under the Law; no more then it followes, that the Goſpell miniſtration is <hi>carnall, beggerly, weak</hi> and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> becauſe that of the Law was ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18. &amp; 9.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. For under the Law, Church memberſhip was veſted in <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed, in which capacity Infants were as well as men; but under the Goſpell that priviledg is proper only to thoſe that are, or appear to be his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſeed, to wit, beleevers, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 26-29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8.) in which capacity Infants are not. Under the Law ſpirituall defilements, ſuch as were ignorance, unbelief; or morall pollutions, ſuch as are extortion, railing, covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. did not exclude perſons from Church memberſhip if they did but keep the ceremoniall Law, which according to the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10. <hi>ſtood only in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and carnal ordinances impoſed on them untill the time of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; which could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience,</hi> which yet unregenerate men were in a capacity to perform: But now under the Goſpell both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and morall defilements, ſuch as are ignorance of God
<pb facs="tcp:110914:8"/>and his wayes, unbelief, covetouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, railing, extortion, &amp;c. doe <hi>de jure</hi> exclude perſons from Church fellowſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. &amp; 15.34. Under the Law, as the ſervice and adminiſtration of that Church did conſiſt <hi>of elements of the world, beggerly rudiments, and carnall ordinances, (Gal.</hi> 4.3.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.) So the members of that Church that were permitted communion in thoſe ordinances,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.1. &amp; 8, 18. &amp; 10.22. Heb. 4 2. Pſal. 81.11. Iſa. 65.2.</note> were (at leaſt ſometimes) for the moſt part but carnall likewiſe; in which reſpect Infants and youths were not leſſe capable of Church memberſhip then they. But now under the Goſpell, God requires ſuch only to worſhip him in his Churches as can <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and truth,</hi> and will have his Churches to be <hi>ſpirituall houſes, built of living stones,</hi> to wit, ſuch as are meet to <hi>be an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Jeſus Chriſt, (Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.) in which capacity Infants are not.</p>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding all that can be pretended to the contrary (for other pretentions beſides theſe I know none) Infant Baptiſm is in a little time like to prove a corrupter of the
<note n="*" place="margin">And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that is none of Chriſts Church wayes, wherein provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Church puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is made but only for one age or half one rather; upon which account among others, the way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency ſeems to me to fall ſhort of the mark and to miſſe of Gods way.</note> Independent Churches themſelves, as well as it hath been of the Nationall; which one would think were to them argument enough alone to cauſe them to lay aſide the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it.</p>
            <p>The premiſes therefore conſidered, Infant Baptiſm that hath proved ſo great a ſnare to men to think themſelves ſecure in an unſafe condition; that hath been as it were the bottom means of erecting Churches contrary to the Goſpell pattern, to the great diſhonour of Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend relation, and ſetting of Antichriſtian officers over them; yea and is likely alſo in a little time to leaven even thoſe Churches themſelves that have been looking after ſome reformation and purity: that Baptiſm I ſay, is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe no <hi>doctrine according to Godlineſſe</hi> as true Baptiſm is, but of ungodlineſſe, of which to me it's more then probable, it hath been a great promotreſſe in the World.</p>
            <p>And therefore to me it clearly appears to be the duty of all thoſe that love the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, and the proſperity of his affaires both in his Churches and in the
<pb facs="tcp:110914:9"/>World, (both which have ſuffered ſo deeply by the ſpringing up of this root of bitterneſſe, as is in part before expreſt) to endeavour with all their might in a Chriſtian way, the extirpation of ſo evill a cuſtome as this hath been, and the reſtitution of primitive Baptiſm as one of thoſe Lawes of our Lord, which corrupt times have made void, as indeed they have done many other: Upon which account I ſhall further encounter the one, and plead the cauſe of the other in the enſuing arguments, to which I refer thee; with humble requeſts to God to give thee an upright heart and ſingle eye in thy examination of them, and ſo much light as to diſcerne that which is of him, from that which is but of men, and ſo much ſpirituall ingenuity and candor as to follow the truth in love when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which both buſies the minds, and takes up much time among the ſervants of God in debates, is that queſtion about Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Which Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moſt agreeable to the mind of God? whether that which is made to Infants (eſpecially ſuch who are the children of believing Parents,) or whether that which is not made, but unto perſons who either do indeed believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or which make ſuch a profeſſion of Faith, which cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be deemed to proceed from ought elſe then that which is Faith indeed?</p>
               <p>The beſt way (I conceive) to come to ſatisfaction hereabout, wil be, to obſerve the footſteps of the flock of Chriſt in the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of this Ordinance of God into the World in the days of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt, and the Apoſtles ſucceſſively. For that now was the method of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he found corruption crept into the adminiſtration of that other Ordinance, the Supper of the Lord; to reform the ſame, he brings thoſe, to whom he writes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, back to the conſideration of the original maner and uſage of that Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. So did our Savior likewiſe, in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110914:10"/>ſome abuſes about marriage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4, 8. And that light, which upon impartial tryal of matters in the holy Hiſtory, ſhall appear the moſt clear and leaſt dubious, that light doubtleſs will it be moſt ſafe for us to follow.</p>
               <p>Now that Baptiſm was adminiſtred to believing and repentant perſons in thoſe times, is no mans doubt that believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but that it was adminiſtred to Infants in thoſe days, is that which the divine Hiſtory no where reports, nor, as is humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, can be duly collected from any part, member, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof.</p>
               <p>That therefore ſhall be the firſt Argument againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which is drawn from the matter of fact in the firſt Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it; and it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Baptiſm were not adminiſtred to Infants in the days of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>I</label> 
                  <hi>nor of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>nor of the</hi> Apoſtles; <hi>then ought it not to be adminiſtred to Infants now.</hi> The reaſon of this Conſequence is this; Becauſe that which was a reaſon to them then to forbear baptizing Infants, and upon which they did forbear it, is, or ought to be, a reaſon to all men now to forbear it likewiſe. For if they did indeed forbear to baptize Infants, it cannot reaſonably be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that they did forbear it meerly out of will and pleaſure, but out of Reaſon and Judgment. And if there be any Reaſons that may induce us to practice Infant-Baptiſm now, which were not obligatory to them then, they muſt ariſe, either, 1. From ſome new diſcovery of God to us in this behalf, of which they were then ignorant; Or, 2. From ſome greater neceſſity now lying upon Infants to be baptized, then Infants were under then: Or, 3. From ſome better capacity in which Infants now ſtand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive benefit by Baptiſm, then was enjoyed by Infants then: Or, 4. From ſome change or alteration of the Ordinance it ſelf, by which it is better fitted and accommodated to the condition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants now, then it was then: Or, 5. (and laſtly) From ſome greater neceſſity and better capacity, which men and women are now in to receive benefit by the baptizing of Infants, then any they were then in formerly: for other then theſe cannot lightly be ſuppoſed or imagined ever to come up into the minds of men. But now there is no new diſcovery made to us touching the Will of God to have Infants baptized, of which <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110914:10"/>or the Apoſtles were ignorant; nor are Infants themſelves, or any others, in any greater neceſſity, or better capacity, to receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Infants Baptiſm now, then they were who lived in times before ſpecified; nor is there any alteration or change indeed in the Ordinance it ſelf, by which it's rendered more uſeful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to Infants now, then it could be then: And therefore, what ever the Reaſons or Conſiderations were, upon which theſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Baptiſts did forbear to baptize Infants, the ſame are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and binding now, to all men in theſe days, ſo to forbear it likewiſe: Which might be backed (if needful) from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Baptiſm was not adminiſtred to Infants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>neither in the days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, nor of the Apoſtles.</hi> This I prove, firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the total ſilence of the Scripture herein, it no where directly or conſequentially affirming or hinting, that it was. And in things of ſuch a religious and divine conſideration, as this is of which we ſpeak, that which is called a Rule in the Civil Law ought to take place, <hi>viz. That which appears not, is not.</hi> The denyal or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of which, what elſe would it be but an inlet to will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and many innovations in the ſervice of God, as indeed it hath proved in the caſe in hand touching Infant-Baptiſm? But the Scripture is expreſs againſt any mans <hi>intruding himſelf into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen,</hi> or of being <hi>wiſe above that which is written, Col.</hi> 2.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. If we had no other proof, yet this Minor Propoſition remains good, until it be proved, that Infants were baptized in the primitive Times. But beſides this, there are other conſiderations, of a proper and potent tendency, to carry the minds of men that are at liberty, and not under the bands of prejudice and partiality, to think and to conceive, that no Infants were baptized in the days and times before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore, ſecondly, When we find the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſetting himſelf to expreſs and ſet forth the power and great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Goſpel in <hi>Samaria,</hi> by that effect it wrought, in cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitudes to be baptized, he expreſſeth thoſe great numbers by making mention of men and women, (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>They were baptized both men and women,</hi>) whereas he ſhould better have anſwered his own end in this behalf, if he had ſaid, they were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110914:11"/>baptized both men, women, and children, if children indeed had been baptized as well as men and women. For, 1. By how many the more perſons it appears are benefited by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by ſo much the more is the power and ſucceſs of it diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and therefore if the Evangeliſt, whileſt he had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to repreſent the glorious ſucceſs of the Goſpel in thoſe great numbers of perſons that were baptized upon its coming among them, ſhould have made mention only of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as he did, and have ſaid nothing of the children, though they had been baptized alſo, which probably might be more in number then the men and women were, he ſhould then ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done that to the one half, which he ſhould have done totally and entirely in relation to his propoſed end. And, 2. By how much the more zeal of obedience the Goſpel doth produce in thoſe perſons that are wrought upon by it, by ſo much the more will the operative influence and ſucceſs of it be viſible and obſervable: and therefore if whileſt the Evangeliſt had been going about to declare how mightily the Goſpel prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe <hi>Samaritans,</hi> in procuring their obedience to it in point of Baptiſm, he ſhould have made mention of the obedience of the men and women, as reaching onely to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Baptiſm, when as indeed they were not onely baptized themſelves, but in obedience to the Goſpel had cauſed their children to be baptized likewiſe, he ſhould have repreſented the zeal of theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> raiſed by the Goſpel, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the powerful influence and ſucceſs of the Goſpel in raiſing that zeal, upon terms of very great diſadvantage, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what he might have done by making known the Childrens Baptiſm as well as the Parents. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he would ſet forth what good effect the Word and Command of God touching Circumciſion had upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, he doth not onely and barely declare <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience by his own perſonal Circumciſion, when there was a further and better account thereof to be given in his circumciſing his ſon, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, together with himſelf: No; but, to make a true and clear repreſentation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience and zeal herein, he reports, firſt how he circumciſed himſelf, after that his ſon, and then his ſervants; yea and that he did it <hi>the ſelf-ſame day
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110914:11"/>which God had ſaid unto him, Gen.</hi> 17.23.
<note place="margin">In the Old Teſtament, when children were brought by their Parents before the Lord in any ſolemn Aſſembly, the Penmen of the Scriptures were as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſet down that, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the deportment of the Parents, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.35. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.1.

And how this exactneſs ſhould be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Narrative about Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet ſuperfluous in <hi>Lukes</hi> Narrative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Baptiſm, eſpecially conſidering that the thing is no where elſe reported, is, I confeſs, a thing, the reaſon whereof, as I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſo I ſhall leave to them to make out, who do imagine any ſuch thing. Therefore the only way to ſtand right in our thoughts towards theſe two <hi>amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> of the Spirit, and not to charge <hi>Moſes</hi> with ſuperfluity, nor <hi>Luke</hi> with deficiency in their reſpective Narratives, is to conclude, that as they were alike directed by the ſame Spirit, ſo they did with like faithfulneſs directly and plainly report the matters of fact in both caſes; and conſequently, that in as much as the Baptiſm of Infants is not recorded, as well as is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm both of men and women, that therefore there was no ſuch thing acted and done in thoſe times, as that is, which is called the baptizing of Infants.</p>
               <p>And that the not mentioning of Childrens Baptiſm doth not proceed from any omiſſion, neglect or deficiency of this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt in his ſaid Narrative, but from the non-being of the thing it ſelf, we have the greater reaſon to believe; not onely becauſe it would be abſurd to ſuppoſe this Penman of the Holy Ghoſt to be ſo partial &amp; untrue to his own intended and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end, as ſuch an omiſſion would argue him to have been; but alſo, becauſe we do find him to have been careful to report even what Children themſelves did by means of their Parents, in a buſineſs of far leſs conſequence then this would have been, had it been at all; and that is their accompanying of <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Tyre;</hi> for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>They all</hi> (to wit, the Diſciples) <hi>brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the City, Acts</hi> 21.5. And why ſhould we think that he ſhould be faithful in the leſs, and not alſo in the greater? or that he would make himſelf in this, like unto thoſe who <hi>tythed Mint and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,</hi>

               <p>If it ſhould be doubted, whether it were the ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Evangeliſt, in thoſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>They were baptized both men and women,</hi> to ſet forth the great ſucceſs of the Goſpel in <hi>Samaria;</hi> ſatisfaction herein may be received, 1. From the import of the phraſe or manner of ſpeaking here uſed, being compared with other places of like form of words; as for example, that of this very Evangeliſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</hi> Here the great numbers that were brought in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord by the Goſpel, are noted by this form of words, <hi>both of men and women:</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. the great ſucceſs of the ſame Goſpel is noted by thoſe great numbers that were prevailed withall by it to be baptized; which great numbers are likewiſe notified by the ſame manner of expreſſion, uſed <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. men and women being mentioned in both their ſexes: <hi>But when they believed Philip preaching the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdom of God, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women.</hi> 2. From the ſcope of the place and Context: in the two precedent Verſes 10.11. the generality of the people, before ſuch time as <hi>Philip</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to them, are ſaid to have <hi>given heed from the leaſt unto the greateſt</hi> unto one <hi>Simon</hi> who was a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> as if he had been <hi>the great power of God:</hi> But in Verſ. 12. ſpeaking of the ſame perſons, and generality of the people, ſhews the wonderful ſucceſs the Goſpel had among them, when it came to be preached by <hi>Philip:</hi> for as before they all gave heed to <hi>Simon</hi> from the leaſt to the greateſt; even ſo now, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Goſpel preached to <hi>Philip,</hi> were baptized both men and women.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That paſſage of Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. wherein ſome are ſaid to have brought young Children (or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.15.) to Chriſt, that he might teach them; and wherein the Diſciples are ſaid to have rebuked thoſe that brought them, and wherein alſo the carriage of Chriſt thereupon is reported, both towards the Diſciples in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, and towards the Infants themſelves, in taking them in his arms and bleſſing them, argues there was no ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110914:12"/>thing practiſed by Chriſt as the baptizing of Infants. For, 1. The end of thoſe that brought them to Chriſt was, that he might touch them, or, as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, <hi>put his hands on them, and pray, Matt.</hi> 19.13. And doubtleſs thoſe who did deſire this of Chriſt, would have deſired much more that he ſhould have baptized them (in ſuch a ſence as Chriſt is ſaid to have baptized thoſe that came to him for that purpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. verſ. 22, 26. and Chap. 4. verſ. 1.) if he practiſed any ſuch thing as the Baptiſm of Infants is ſuppoſed to be: their non-deſiring of it under ſuch circumſtances, argues the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of any ſuch thing to be had. 2. In that the Diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked thoſe that brought theſe Infants, it argues that it was an unuſual thing for ſuch Children to be brought to Chriſt, and that the Diſciples thought it an impertinent thing to trouble him with them; which apprehenſion and carriage of theirs, could not lightly have taken place with them, if Children had been accuſtomed to have been brought to his Baptiſm. 3. In that Chriſt did ſo highly approve of this application of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of theſe Children to him, as is declared he did; and in that he did alſo embrace the Children and bleſs them, and yet ſo left them, without proceeding to baptize them; it argues, with ſtrength of probability, that he did not uſe to baptize any other Infants: for it cannot lightly be thought but that theſe Infants were as capable of Baptiſm as any others. 4. Since three of the Evangeliſts do ſo carefully, punctually, and largely ſet down the Hiſtory of the bringing of theſe Infants to Chriſt, and of his carriage towards them, and yet not any one of them giving the leaſt hint of any Infants being brought to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, nor of any being baptized by him or his Diſciples; why ſhould we think, but that if there had been any ſuch matter of fact, as the baptizing of Infants, that had come under their cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and obſervation, but that they would have been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if not more careful, to have recorded that, as well as thoſe things they did record touching them, in as much as ſuch a thing as the baptizing of Infants, if it had been an Ordinance of God, the knowledg thereof would have been of as great or greater uſe unto the world, then the knowledg of thoſe other things are touching Chriſts embracing and bleſſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110914:13"/>Infants, which yet they have left on record for our learning.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That deſcription which the Scripture everywhere makes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the perſons and qualifications of ſuch whoſe Baptiſm it records, argues them to be no Infants whoſe Baptiſm is ſo recorded, the qualifications of all ſuch perſons being incompetible to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. For either they were ſuch as attended to the Word, and received it gladly, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.14, 15.) or ſuch as confeſſed their ſins, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5.) or ſuch as believed, (<hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> chap. 8. verſ. 37.) or elſe ſuch as were Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. And as we cannot reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Infants are by any of theſe or the like qualifications deſcribed; no more can we rationally ſuppoſe, that they were baptized in thoſe times to which theſe deſcriptions relate. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Both the inſtructions given to thoſe who were commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to baptize, and the practice of ſuch perſons who did baptize, argue the perſons that were baptized by them to be no Infants. For, 1. The inſtruction which Chriſt gave thoſe which he commiſſioned on this behalf, was, that they ſhould firſt teach perſons, or make them Diſciples, and then baptize them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. 2. The practiſe of them who did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, was anſwerable to this commiſſion; they firſt inſtructed perſons in the things of the Goſpel, and then baptized them: <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.32, 33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.4, 5. But now in as much as Infants, whileſt ſuch, are not capable of receiving inſtruction in the things of the Goſpel, or of being taught, therefore it cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that Infants, whileſt ſuch, ſhould be of that ſort or number of perſons, who were by Chriſts commiſſion to be baptized, or who were by any baptized in purſuance of that commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But againſt this firſt Argument, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> in which we aſſert no Infants to be baptized in the Apoſtles times, it is objected; That when the Scripture declareth, that whole houſholds were baptized, it may well be preſumed that Infants were baptized, becauſe they, in what houſe ſoever they are, are part of that houſhold: Now it is ſaid expreſly, that <hi>Lydia was baptized, and her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Acts</hi> 16.15. That the <hi>Jaylor was baptized, he and all his, Acts</hi> 16.33. and alſo, that <hi>Paul baptized the houſhould of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:110914:13"/>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, firſt, That it doth not at all appear, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> that there were any Infants in any of thoſe houſholds mentioned in the Objection, and that therefore it is but a meer preſumption to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it, in as much as Experience teacheth, that it is a common thing for houſholds and families to conſiſt of ſuch perſons, among whom are no Infants: and there are no circumſtances in the Texts alledged, that give the leaſt hint or intimation, that thoſe houſholds were any other then ſuch. Nay, the circumſtances of that Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Baptiſm of <hi>Lydia</hi> (which yet will be found the onely Text that can colourably be pretended, ſo much as in the leaſt to countenance the thing objected) do much rather induce us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there were no Infants in that family: Becauſe ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcribed as the head of that family, it is very queſtionable whether ſhe were a maid, or a widow, and conſequently ſo much the more queſtionable whether ſhe had any children at all; or if ſhe had, and was a widow, it is yet ſo much the more doubtful whether her children were Infants, or of riper age.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer yet further, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> That though it ſhould be granted for Arguments ſake, that poſſibly there might be Infants in ſome or all thoſe houſholds which are ſaid to be baptized, yet it no wiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that therefore thoſe Infants are ſaid to be baptized, when thoſe houſholds are ſaid ſo to be. For it is an uſual thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to attribute ſuch things unto, or predicate ſuch things of and concerning a houſe or whole houſhold, which yet cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be underſtood as meant of every individual perſon in ſuch an houſe, and ſpecially not of Infants. But ſuch attributions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, in common ſence and acceptation, muſt neceſſarily be underſtood to relate, 1. To ſuch as are commonly and familiarly known to be capable of them, otherwiſe then Infants either are or can be, whileſt ſuch: Or, 2. To the major part for number in thoſe families: Or elſe, 3. To ſo conſiderable a part thereof, which by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is frequently put for the whole. Inſtances of this nature that might be given are many, in which houſholds are to be underſtood according to one or more of the three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations now mentioned; as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 35.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50.4. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21, 22. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 35.3, 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.25. In ſome of which foreſaid reſpects it is, I ſuppoſe, that whole houſholds are ſometimes ſaid to believe, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.53. <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:110914:14"/>16.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.8. ſometimes to fear and ſerve the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. and ſometimes to be ſaluted as ſuch, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10, 11. And as there is no reaſon to conceive, that Infants are intended in thoſe things aſſerted concerning theſe houſholds mentioned in theſe Scriptures, the things themſelves being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to Infants; ſo likewiſe is there no more reaſon to imagine, that Infants are intended when houſholds are ſaid to be baptized, they being no more capable of that regularly, then they are of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21. it's ſaid, That <hi>the man Elkanah and all his houſe, went up to offer to the Lord the yearly ſacrifice, and his vow:</hi> and yet it is evident, Verſ. 22. that <hi>Hannah, Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's</hi> wife, and <hi>Samuel</hi> his ſon, which were part of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, did not then go up to the place of publique worſhip. And therefore when <hi>Lydia</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>baptized, ſhe and her houſhold,</hi> it no more neceſſary hereby to underſtand her and her children, if ſhe had any, then it is by <hi>Elkanah, and all his houſe,</hi> to underſtand both himſelf and his young ſon <hi>Samuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> I yet further anſwer, That as concerning two of the three houſholds mentioned in the Objection, it is evident that they did believe before they were baptized; for as it is ſaid of the Jaylor, that <hi>he was baptized, and all his, ſtraightway, Act.</hi> 16.33. ſo alſo is it ſaid, Verſ. 32. that they <hi>ſpake unto him the Word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe:</hi> and in Verſ. 34. that he <hi>rejoyced, believing in God with all his houſe.</hi> And whereas <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>baptized the houſhold of Stephanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. in Chap. 16. of the ſame Epiſtle, Verſ. 15. this houſhold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> is ſaid to conſiſt of ſuch perſons as addicted themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Saints: <hi>Ye know the houſhold of Stephanus, that it is the firſt fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the miniſtry of the Saints.</hi> If then, it cannot reaſonably be thought that Infants heard and underſtood the Word of the Lord, or believed in God, or addicted themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Saints, as thoſe of theſe houſholds, which were baptized, did; no more can it, with any colour of reaſon, be ſuppoſed, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were baptized when thoſe houſholds were baptized. And though there be not the ſame particular account given of the like qualifications in thoſe that were baptized of the family of <hi>Lydia;</hi> yet, according to that rule by which thoſe Scriptures, that ſpeak
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110914:14"/>of things more generally and briefly, are to be interpreted, by or according to the tenor of thoſe that treat of the ſame or like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more particularly and expreſly, we are to reckon, that the ſame or like qualifications were found in the houſhold of <hi>Lydia,</hi> which were in thoſe of the houſholds of the <hi>Jaylor</hi> and <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and upon which they were alike baptized. And thus much for the anſwering of this firſt Objection.</p>
               <p>If it be further objected, That this firſt Argument, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts Infant-Baptiſm unlawful, becauſe it is no where ſaid in the Scripture that Infants were baptized, is as well an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt womens having communion in the Supper of the Lord, as againſt Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe it is no more ſaid any where that women did participate of the Lords Supper, then it is that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were baptized; To this likewiſe I anſwer briefly,</p>
               <p>Though it be no where expreſly and in ſo many words ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> that women did break bread, or were partakers of the Table of the Lord, &amp;c. yet there is that ſaid, by which it may be as ſafely collected that they did ſo do, as if it had been aſſerted in ſo many words. For it is ſaid, That <hi>thoſe that were baptized, continued,</hi> as <hi>in the Apostles doctrine and fellowſhip,</hi> ſo <hi>in breaking of bread and prayers, Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. But now women were baptized as well as men, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. therefore women, as well as men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in breaking of bread and prayers. Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. it's ſaid, that <hi>the Diſciples came together to break bread:</hi> but now women were Diſciples as well as men, and therefore we have every whit as much reaſon to underſtand that ſaying of them, as of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.36. Now then, if any thing were aſſerted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning Infants, by which it might be as plainly collected and gathered, that they were baptized, as it may be inferred, that women did eat the Lords Supper, from what is aſſerted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; then it might well be ſaid indeed, that this firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as well againſt womens having communion with men in the Supper of the Lord, as it is againſt Infants Baptiſm; but till this appear, or ſomething like it, this Objection is of no force to invalidate our Argument.</p>

               <head>ARGUM. II.</head>
               <p>MY ſecond Argument ſhall be taken from the nature of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and from the declared ends and uſes of it; and it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If that Administration of Baptiſm, which is made to profeſſed Beleevers, do more conduce to, and better anſwer the ends of Baptiſm, then that does which is made to Infants; then Baptiſm ought not to be adminiſtred to Infants, but to profeſſed Beleevers.</hi> The reaſon hereof is clear; becauſe it is the duty of men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor, as much as in them lies, to obſerve and keep the Laws of every Ordinance of God in the beſt manner they know how, and not to content themſelves with a lower and meaner way of doing and performing the ſame, when there is an opportunity before them of riſing up to that which is more excellent, and which doth more exactly anſwer the counſel and intendment of God in it. If this were any mans doubt, it might be confirmed from ſuch Scriptures, which condemn ſuch practices of men as moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and accurſed, who having an opportunity of preſenting God with a better ſacrifice or ſervice, do yet preſent him with that which is worſe: <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Thoſe Scriptures likewiſe vote the ſame thing, which require, That men <hi>ſeek to excel, to the edifying of the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.12. That hold forth ways that are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then others, as to be more deſired and ſtriven for then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that Administration of Baptiſm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>which is made to profeſſed Believers, does more conduce to, and better anſwer the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then that which is made to Infants.</hi> The truth of this will appear, by comparing Baptiſm as adminiſtred to the one and to the other, in relation to the ſeveral ends and uſes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One end of Baptiſm is, to declare Jeſus Chriſt unto the World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.31. <hi>But that he</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>ſhould be made manifeſt unto Iſrael, therefore am I come, baptizing with water.</hi> For he who is rightly baptized into Chriſt, or Faith in his Name,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110914:15"/>doth thereby profeſs Jeſus Chriſt to be a worthy perſon, meet to be believed in, and himſelf his ſervant and diſciple. Beſides, the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt being repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Baptiſm, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.) it adminiſters an occaſion unto men, to enquire what an one Chriſt is, for what end he came into the World, dyed, was buried, and roſe again; and ſo knowledg of him and ſalvation by him is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by propagated.</p>
               <p>This manifeſtation of Chriſt is better made by the Baptiſm of Believers, then by the Baptiſm of Infants, whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the party who is baptized, or others who behold it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is true in reſpect of him who is baptized, becauſe he is in a capacity, by reaſon of the uſe and exerciſe of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to receive that information and knowledg concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, which is intended by God in that Ordinance, of which reception Infants, whileſt ſuch, are altogether uncapable, in as much as they have <hi>no knowledg between good and evil,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As this end of Baptiſm reſpects Spectators, it is more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual unto them when adminiſtred unto Believers, then when adminiſtred to Infants; becauſe the example of ſuch who are voluntarily and actually obedient, from ſound principles of knowledg, unto the Will of God, in ſubmitting to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, and whoſe Faith in Chriſt is viſible in their being willingly and deſirouſly baptized into his Name; I ſay, their example is much more apt, both to quicken men unto a ſerious conſideration of what is held out in that Ordinance, as likewiſe unto the imitation of their Faith and Repentance viſible in it, then is the Baptiſm of Infants, who are meerly paſſive therein, and who neither are or can be moved thereunto by any inward principle, nor at all religiouſly affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor exhibit any example of Faith or Repentance for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imitate. As one Cock ſets another on crowing, ſo the devout and religious carriage of one, in uſing an holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is apt to take upon the minds of others, and to kindle the ſame fire in them: <hi>Your zeal,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked very many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p>That the Baptiſm of Believers hath ſuch an excellent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110914:16"/>in it, appears from <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.32. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29. <hi>For John came unto you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye beleeved him not; but the Publicans and Harlots beleeved him: And ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterward, that ye might beleeve.</hi> Here, 1. Our Saviour upbraids the Prieſts and Elders with their impenitency and unbelief. 2. That by which he aggravates their offence, is their neglect of that means and opportunity of Faith and Repentance which they had. 3. The means or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inducing them to Repentance and Faith, which they did neglect, it was that practice of the Publicans and Harlots, whereby they gave account of their Faith: For their Faith was ſuch, in the effects of it, as was viſible to the Prieſts and Elders: (<hi>And ye, when ye had ſeen it, viz.</hi> the Publicans and Harlots <hi>beleeving of John, repented not, &amp;c.</hi>) 4. That account which theſe Publicans and Harlots gave of their Faith, and that in which their Faith was viſible to the Prieſts and Elders, and by which they ought to have been moved to Repentance and Faith, it was their being baptized upon their believing the Doctrine of <hi>John.</hi> For that which <hi>Matthew</hi> here calls their believing of <hi>John, Luke</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame thing (as I conceive) calls it their <hi>juſtifying God, in being baptized ef John, Luke</hi> 7.29. In as much then, as the fight or beholding that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or declaration of the Faith of the Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, in their ſubmitting to Baptiſm, was a great aggravation of the impenitency and unbelief of the Prieſts and Elders, in that they having ſuch an example before them, and ſuch a motive and provocation upon them to believe, and yet did not believe; evident it is, that there was in the deportment of the Publicans and Harlots, when they were baptized, ſomething of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a motive or means, that was apt to prevail with the Prieſts and Elders to follow their example; for otherwiſe it would never have been produced againſt them by our Saviour as an aggravation of their ſin in not doing likewiſe: For it therefore became an aggravation of their ſin being committed, becauſe it was a means of preſerving them from it before it was committed. From the whole this is moſt evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Baptiſm of the Publicans and Harlots, and yet not ſo much that neither, as that Faith and Repentance of theirs which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110914:16"/>was viſible in their Baptiſm, was in it ſelf a potent means and ſtrong incitement to the Prieſts and Elders, and conſequently unto others, to repent and believe, and to expreſs the ſame in like manner as the Publicans had done, their ſin in oppoſition hereunto being their <hi>rejecting the counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in not being baptized, Luk.</hi> 7.30.</p>
               <p>But now, there is no ſuch example of Faith or Repentance that is viſible in the Baptiſm of Infants, and conſequently no ſuch incitement unto, or means of working Faith, in by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſpectators; and therefore Baptiſm adminiſtred unto Infants, is no ſuch means of propagating the knowledg of Chriſt, and Faith in him, as when it is adminiſtred unto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Believers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another end and uſe of Baptiſm, is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to ſerve the deſign of God touching the great buſineſs of Repentance for remiſſion of ſins; for it is called the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. There are ſeveral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in reſpect of which, or ſome of which, I conceive, it is ſo called; all which are better anſwered in that Adminiſtration of it which is made to men and women who are Believers, then in that which is made to Infants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it ſhall be conceived, that it is therefore called the Baptiſm of Repentance for remiſſion of ſins, becauſe ſuch who are at any time duly baptized, do take up that Ordinance out of a principle of Repentance, upon which they look for remiſſion of ſins according to the promiſe of God in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, (which if it be, the ſaying contains a <hi>metonymy</hi> of the cauſe for the effect, a thing not unuſual in Scripture,) yet this denomination and uſe of it, is better ſerved in mens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then in childrens; becauſe Infants have no ſuch principle or act in them as Repentance is, and therefore their Baptiſm can neither proceed from, or be declarative of ſuch a cauſe; whereas the Baptiſm of repentant perſons, does both flow from, and is expreſſive of, ſuch a cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be called the Baptiſm of Repentance, becauſe men, by taking up that Ordinance, do engage themſelves to the practice of repentance and mortification, (as the Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the believing <hi>Romans</hi> to have done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2-6.) then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110914:17"/>this end is better provided for in the Baptiſm of men, then of Infants. The reaſon is, becauſe an engagement to practiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſuppoſes, 1. An end of Repentance, 2. A capacity of performing that to which they do engage; neither of which are to be found in Infants, and both which are to be found in men; therefore this end of Baptiſm cannot be attained in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Baptiſm, but in mens.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be called the Baptiſm of Repentance for remiſſion of ſins, becauſe God thereby ſignifies and ſeals unto men the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſins upon their Repentance; this end and uſe likewiſe is better anſwered in mens Baptiſm who do repent, then in Infants who do not. 1. Becauſe men who have begun to repent, are in a good capacity to receive confirmation and eſtabliſhment in their hope and confidence of receiving remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins from God upon their Repentance, and conſolation thereby; whereas Infants, whileſt ſuch, are altogether unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any ſuch thing, in reſpect whereof this end is made fruſtrate when Baptiſm is given to them. 2. Becauſe there is a greater appearance both of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in vouchſafing and applying ſuch a means as Baptiſm is, to ſtrengthen mens Faith in his promiſe of remiſſion of ſins upon their Repentance, unto ſuch who, 1. Have need of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and, 2. Are capable of receiving it, then there is in that application of it which is made to Infants, who neither have need of it, nor yet are capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be called the Baptiſm of Repentance for remiſſion of ſins, becauſe the perſons who are baptized do thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and declare unto the world, that they look for remiſſion of their ſins from God upon their Repentance, yet this end alſo is better anſwered in mens Baptiſm, then in Infants: becauſe men are capable of making ſuch a profeſſion and declaration of themſelves to the world in and by their Baptiſm, when as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are altogether uncapable of doing any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it be called the Baptiſm of Repentance, &amp;c. becauſe it ſeals and confirms the Covenant or Promiſes of God made to men, touching the remiſsion of their ſins upon their Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet this end and uſe alſo is attained upon far better terms
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110914:17"/>in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm to Believers, and to men of underſtanding, then it is or can be when adminiſtred to Infants who have neither. For if this end and uſe ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this denomination of Baptiſm, yet this muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; That the intent of God, in making Baptiſm a Seal of his Covenant and Promiſe, is not to make his Covenant more ſure in it ſelf, but to give it thereby a more ſure, ſtable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Being in the minds and apprehenſions of men: and if ſo, this end cannot be attained in Infants by their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, becauſe they want the uſe and exerciſe of their reaſon, judgment, and underſtanding, without which the Articles and terms of Gods Covenant will never take place, or have a Being in the minds of any, by way of belief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another end of Baptiſm ſeems to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That ſuch who are baptized, might thereby ſignifie their acceptance of, and conſent unto the terms of the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace. For the Covenant of God with men does conſiſt of certain Articles to be obſerved and kept by each party covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Covenants amongſt men generally do. And as amongſt men the parties covenanting are wont to ſignifie their mutual conſent to their reſpective Articles, by ſome ſolemn act of theirs in the preſence of witneſſes; as by ſigning, ſealing, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. So God, in the Covenant between him and men, will have ſomething like unto this done by men publiquely, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their conſent to the terms of it, as well as what is done by him to declare his readineſs to do and perform what he hath undertaken on his part. Now Faith in Chriſt, and an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential ſubjection to all his Laws and Precepts, being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Covenant on mans part; at what time ſoever he enters into Covenant with God, and undertakes the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the condition, he is to ſign and ſeal the ſame in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of witneſſes by that ſolemn act of his in being baptized. In this reſpect eſpecially I conceive it is, that Baptiſm is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, (Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3.) becauſe men are to take up that Ordinance upon their firſt beginning to repent, in order to the remiſſion of their ſins. For like reaſon I ſuppoſe it is called <hi>the waſhing of regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3.5. becauſe men, upon their being born
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110914:18"/>again, are to be baptized, according to what was practiſed in the Apoſtles times. Hence it is likewiſe, as may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that mens being <hi>born of water, and of the Spirit, (Joh.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, (Tit.</hi> 3.5.) are joyned together; not becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit works Regeneration in and by Baptiſm, if we reſpect the beginning of it; but becauſe the work of Regeneration by the Spirit, and the Baptiſm of water, which is declarative thereof, are neerly conjoyned in reſpect of time, if he who is regenerate by the Spirit do but what becomes him: <hi>And now why tarryeſt thou, ariſe and be baptized, Acts</hi> 22.16. — <hi>And was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, he and all his, ſtraightway, Acts</hi> 16.33. Finally, Beleeving, and being baptized, are conjoyned as relative to Salvation, (<hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.) and Baptiſm hath its rank, place, or ſtanding in Scripture next after Faith, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was one of the firſt fruits of Faith, by which they gave account to the world, that they did believe indeed, and was doubtleſs eſteemed a proof of Faith, and without which they were not reckoned Diſciples of Chriſt, notwithſtanding any other overtures that ways made.</p>
               <p>That both Repentance, and the declaration of it by Baptiſm, is required on mans part, to intereſs him in remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification of the Spirit, the things covenanted or promiſed on Gods part; is too evident to be denyed by any, but thoſe that will not ſee, from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt: For the Promiſe is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> And that God did not intend this way only for thoſe to whom theſe words were then ſpoken, or for the men and women of that generation onely, but that it was to be his ſtanding method through all generations, appears, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Promiſe, to wit, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and gift of the Spirit, which was made on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Repentance and Baptiſm, was made, not onely to them then, and their children, but to thoſe that were further remote, to thoſe afar off, even to all whom the Lord our God ſhall call. And if this be one end and uſe of Baptiſm, as you ſee, for perſons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110914:18"/>thereby to enter their publique aſſent and conſent unto the terms of the Goſpel upon their cordial embracing of it, then the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants is voyded as to this uſe alſo, in as much as they are uncapable of exerting any act of heart or mind by way of aſſent or conſent to the terms of the Goſpel, or to ſignifie any ſuch thing by a voluntary ſubmiſſion to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another excellent effect and uſe of Baptiſm, is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thereby to juſtifie God in the ſight of the world, as touching the truth of his ſayings in the Goſpel; for ſo it's ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29. <hi>That all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Baptiſm of John.</hi> When it's ſaid, <hi>they juſtified God,</hi> the meaning is (I conceive) that they declared him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tenor of their Faith, to be juſt and true in that Doctrine of Salvation which was preached to them by his appointment, and which they had embraced; for ſo to juſtifie God, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him juſt and true in his ſayings; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyar, as it is written, that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, &amp;c.</hi> They are ſaid to juſtifie God in being baptized, becauſe by their voluntary ſubmiſſion to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they did declare, that they judged the Doctrine and Precepts of the Goſpel, of which Baptiſm is a part, moſt worthy belief and obedience, as coming from God.</p>
               <p>But in as much as Infants are onely paſſive in Baptiſm, and not at all active or voluntary, they cannot contribute any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Juſtification of God, in their approbation of, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential ſubjection to his Goſpel in their Baptiſm: and therefore this end of Baptiſm alſo ſuffers diſappointment as oft as it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to Infants.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Another great end of Baptiſm, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> when taken up by perſons under due qualifications, is, to diſtinguiſh and difference them from the world, and to characterize them as peculiarly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God: In which reſpect, amongſt others, all thoſe that <hi>are baptized into Chriſt, are ſaid to put on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.27. they thereby declare themſelves to belong to him, as the ſervants of great men are known to belong to them, by their badg and livery which they put on, when they enter themſelves ſervants to them. The Apoſtle from Verſ. 23. of that <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. to Verſ. 27. ſhews the uſe of the Law during the time of that Adminiſtration, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110914:19"/>the uſe of Faith and Baptiſm now under the Goſpel. He ſaith verſ. 23. that they were <hi>ſhut up under the Law until Faith came,</hi> meaning, I conceive, that by the Ceremonies and Moſaical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, they were encloſed about, and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Nations, as one mans ground is from anothers by an hedg or wall, or as a garden, by the wall that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe it, is differenced from common ground, according to that <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. <hi>A garden encloſed is my ſiſter, my Spouſe, a ſpring ſhut up, a fountain ſealed.</hi> Hereupon the Jewiſh Rites are called <hi>a middle wall of partition</hi> between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; Eph.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>During the time therefore of this legal Diſpenſation, that which did denominate them to be the people of God, was their obſervation and keeping of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is frequently uſed to note ſuch to be none of Gods people, but of the profane world, who were under that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But now this way of differencing men laſted but till ſuch time as Faith came, as the Apoſtle notes; <hi>But after Faith is come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are no longer under a Schoolmaſter,</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> no longer known to be Diſciples or Schollars, as formerly we were by our keeping of the Law. The Moſaical Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued till Faith came, <hi>i. e.</hi> until the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Diſpenſation; and then Faith became of the ſame uſe to denominate and diſtinguiſh who were the children of God, and who not; which the Law and Ceremonies were of before: for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, Verſ. 26. <hi>For ye are (i. e.</hi> now ye are) <hi>all the children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. By faith</hi> (which here is ſaid to have come when the Schoolmaſterſhip of the Law ended) is meant, I conceive, the confeſſing or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Chriſt Jeſus to be come in the fleſh, and to be the Son of God and Saviour of the world. That this is the Faith here ſpoken of, and that this Faith was it by which men were to be diſtinguiſhed as the children of God, from thoſe which were not, we have the greater reaſon to believe, not onely becauſe this beſt agrees with the Apoſtles ſcope here, but alſo becauſe it exactly agrees with other Scriptures, where this very Faith, or acknowledgment, is made the diſtinguiſhing character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110914:19"/>thoſe that are of God, and thoſe that are not; as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every ſpirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God: and every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God.</hi> Where the Apoſtle then, in the 26 Verſe of this third Chapter of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and this by way of diſtinction from that thing by which men were reckoned to be the children of God under the Law; I conceive he doth not onely, if ſo much, ſpeak of this Faith, as conſtituting or making thoſe, in whom it is, the children of God; for ſo men were the children of God by Faith under the Law, as well as in times of the Goſpel; they being then juſtified by Faith in him that was to come, as we are now juſtified by Faith in him as being come; ſo that the Apoſtle, differencing Faith from the Law, does not difference Faith under the Goſpel from Faith under the Law; but when he ſays, <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith, &amp;c.</hi> he means, that they were declared and known ſo to be now, by their acknowledgment of Chriſt; whereas they were wont to be deemed ſuch by the uſe of the Law, to which they were then Schollars. And hereof he gives this reaſon or account, v. 27. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt:</hi> So that the Faith, what ever it is, by which they were ſaid to be <hi>the children of God,</hi> in Verſ. 26. muſt be the ſame in effect with that which he calls the putting on of Chriſt in Baptiſm, Verſ. 27. becauſe he aſſerts the former up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the taking place of the latter. And that this putting on of Chriſt by Baptiſm, is not to be underſtood ſtrictly of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act of their Faith, but of their profeſſion of this Faith, is evident, not only from the nature of the ſervice by which men publiquely liſt themſelves the ſervants of Chriſt, but alſo from the import and ſignification of the phraſe or expreſſion here uſed, and that is the putting on of Chriſt, which is a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor borrowed from the putting on of apparel, or ſomething which men viſibly wear. Beſides, their putting on of Chriſt in Baptiſm, would be no reaſon why they were the children of God by Faith in Chriſt, if we ſhould underſtand their being the children of God conſtitutively, and not declaratively, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110914:20"/>we will ſuppoſe, that man is the child of God in his account, notwithſtanding his believing in Chriſt, until he be baptized into Chriſt. But if we underſtand the Apoſtle here to ſpeak of Faith, that is, the profeſſion of Faith, or the acknowledgment of Chriſt, as that which doth declare who are the children of God, then this ſaying of his, that becauſe they had been baptized into Chriſt, that therefore they had put on Chriſt, was a good reaſon or proof of their being known to be the children of God, by their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Chriſt; becauſe by their putting on of Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and clothing themſelves with his Name, they did declare whoſe children they were, and who it was they worſhipped and reſolved to ſerve, and from whom they expected remiſſion of ſin, and the Salvation of their Souls. For ſo to be baptized into Chriſt, what is it elſe, but to be baptized into the belief, profeſſion, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt? and to reſign up ones ſelf to be his. <hi>If ye be Chriſts,</hi> ſays he, Verſ. 29. (as he ſuppoſes them to be, upon that very account of their being baptized into him, as will appear, if you compare v. 27, 28, 29. together; <hi>If ye be Christs) then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe.</hi> The upſhot or reſult then of this piece of the Apoſtles diſcourſe is, That perſons by Baptiſm do make ſuch a profeſsion of Chriſt, as by which they are characterized to be his. If this then be the characteriſtical mark to diſtinguiſh the children of God from the world, then it will follow, that no other acknowledgment of Chriſt without this, or with neglect of this, is to be looked upon as any other then a partial owning of Chriſt, and not a compleat putting him on, ſo as to be eſteemed thereby viſibly the children of God.</p>
               <p>Which thing may be yet further confirmed by that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> That it is the Baptiſm by water that is here ſpoken of, is the general ſence of Interpreters, ſo far as their judgment herein is come to any knowledg and obſervation. The body into which we are ſaid to be baptized, is the myſtical Body of Chriſt, made up of Chriſt as head, and of the Saints as members. In that by one Spirit they are ſaid to be baptized hereinto, we are to underſtand, I conceive, that it is by the work of the Spirit upon their hearts, by which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110914:20"/>men are inclined to ſeek memberſhip, or fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Saints, in this way of Baptiſm, as being the way of God to attain hereunto. But that which is principally for our purpoſe, is, that men and women are initiated and brought into this Body by Baptiſm: <hi>They are baptized into one Body.</hi> And if their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereinto be made by Baptiſm, then it's evident, that they are not to be reckoned to be of this Body till they be baptized, and conſequently that Baptiſm is the viſible door by which man enter into this ſpiritual corporation, and a wall of partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the world and the Saints.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Scriptures witneſs the ſame thing alſo, which ſpeak of mens being <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> and of their being <hi>planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, Rom.</hi> 6.3, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. For can we conclude leſs hence, then that mens viſible being in Chriſt is to be reckoned from the time of their Baptiſm? that being, as it were, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſtrument or means of their viſible ingreſsion into him. For otherwiſe, if they were to be looked upon as having a viſible Being in Chriſt, by any act, endowment, or qualification preceding Baptiſm, why ſhould their ingreſsion, their entrance into Chriſt, be attributed unto their Baptiſm? If mens owning of Chriſt, which ſtill did precede their Baptiſm, had been ſufficient, as God accounts ſufficient, to have aſſerted or declared their viſible or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſible ſtanding in Chriſt, doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt would not have aſcribed, or rather appropriated, the ſame unto their Baptiſm, as now he hath done. For, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law:</hi> If the Law had been ſufficient to have given life, God would not have ſuper-added the promiſe of the Goſpel for the ſame end, for he makes nothing in vain: ſo we may ſay in this caſe, if any qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, action or profeſsion, preceding Baptiſm, could have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered mens being in Chriſt knowable, upon terms agreeable to the wiſdom of God, he would not have ſuper-added Baptiſm for the ſame end.</p>
               <p>But it ſhould ſeem to be in this caſe, as it is amongſt men; A Major or Sheriff receives that kind of Civil or Magiſtratical Being, by which he is diſtinguiſhed from other men, from ſome ſolemn acts done at the time of his enſtalment into his Office: and as a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110914:21"/>Husband and Wife receive that conjugal relation and matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Being, proper to them, from ſome ſolemn act done at the time of their marriage: or as a man receives a relative Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as member of ſuch a Corporation, by ſome ſolemn act done at the time of his enfranchiſement: even ſo, according to the import of theſe Scriptures now inſiſted on, men and women receive that relative Being, which they have in Chriſt, and as viſible members of that ſpiritual Corporation wherein Chriſt is head and chief, from that ſolemn act of their being baptized into him. And as a Major or Sheriff is not veſted with his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or Husband and Wife with that power over the bodies of each other, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. nor yet any member of a body corporate, with thoſe immunities proper to him, by any prequalification or action preparatory thereunto, until firſt that be acted and done by way of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which appropriately and immediately does inveſt them with their ſeveral and reſpective capacities; in like manner, none are to be eſteemed to be in Chriſt, or capable of thoſe ſpiritual priviledges which viſibly do belong to the body of Chriſt, the Church, upon the account of any precedaneous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, profeſſion, or action whatſoever, until firſt they have paſſed through thoſe ſpiritual ſolemnities in Baptiſm, by and upon which they are inveſted with the denomination and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible priviledges which do belong in common to the members of Chriſt myſtical body.</p>
               <p>By the way; I have inſiſted the more largely upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to detect the repugnancy of that Opinion, againſt the plain current of the Scripture, which holds Baptiſm needleſs, uſeleſs amongſt thoſe that have long made profeſſion of the Goſpel, though they as yet never were baptized. But it may be I ſhall deal further with this conceit in a place by it ſelf, and therefore ſhall come to bring home what hath been diſcourſed on this head to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If then that publique owning of Chriſt in Baptiſm, by which men put him on, and by and upon which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into Chriſt viſibly, be another end and uſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as you ſee it is, moſt clear and evident it is, that this end and uſe is not to be found in the Baptiſm of Infants. And the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110914:21"/>reaſon hereof is, becauſe Intants neither do not can put on Chriſt in their Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> make an actual declaration and profeſſion unto the world, that they own and acknowledg Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, to be the Son of God, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, to be their Lord and Lawgiver, as they do who put him on in Baptiſm. If the Apoſtle had intended to have expreſſed the incorporation of Infants into Chriſt by Baptiſm, ſure he would have ſaid, that Chriſt had put them on, or had put himſelf upon them, and not that they had put him on; or elſe, that they were thereby put into Chriſt by their Parents that offered them to Baptiſm, or by him who did baptize them, and not that they themſelves had put him on (as now the words carry it) ſeeing they are onely paſſive in their Baptiſm. But now the words of the Apoſtle are expreſs, that <hi>as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have</hi> (that is, you, even you your ſelves have) <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi> And therefore in as much as Infants cannot, with any propriety or truth of ſpeaking, be ſaid to put on Chriſt in Baptiſm, neither can they any whit more properly or truly be ſaid to be baptized into Chriſt; becauſe the Apoſtle makes the one, to wit, the putting on of Chriſt, as general and univerſal as the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the being baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwer, by way of negation, <label type="milestone">

               <p n="1">1. There is no ſuch accommodation to, or correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Baptiſm in the letter of it, and its ſpiritual ends, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Infants, as there was between Circumciſion in the letter of it, and its more ſpiritual ends; becauſe the proper end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion being by Gods own appointment <hi>for a token or ſign of the Covenant between God</hi> and that people to whom it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.11.</note> this token or ſign was not any tranſient thing (I mean, as touching the letter of it) that did paſs away in the acting of it, but was permanent and laſting, ſo that the ſign it ſelf, and the Covenant to which it related, remained in the fleſh of him who was circumciſed, all the days of his life, as viſible to him, and as capable of improvement to ſpiritual ends, many years after it was made, as if it had been but newly acted and done before his eyes. <hi>My Covenant</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall be in your fleſh</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> remain there) <hi>for an everlasting Covenant, Geneſ.</hi> 17.13. Whereas Baptiſm is a tranſient act, and leaves no ſuch viſible impreſſion in the Infant, as matter of memorial, ſignification, or inſtruction to him when he comes to be a man, as that of Circumciſion did: ſo that we ſee there is not the like reaſon, but an apparent difference in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be truly ſaid, That either the report of Parents or Neighbors, or any Pariſh, or other Regiſter, is or can be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unto the ſign in the fleſh before mentioned, as to the aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men and women of their being baptized in their Infancy: 1. Becauſe there is not the like certainty nor ſatisfaction in reports and hear-ſays, as there is in ſeeing and beholding, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence notwithſtanding we have in theſe two caſes in hand. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe opportunity of ſuch ſatisfaction, as theſe reports, &amp;c. are capable of giving, may be cut off by the death or other removal of ſuch from whom it is to be received, or elſe by the removal of ſuch Infants themſelves into places far remote, before ever they come to age; upon occaſion whereof it may well fall out many times, that perſons may be at a great loſs as touching any knowledg
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110914:22"/>they have, or can get, whether they were ever baptized or no: which inconveniency was not incident to Infants Circumciſion. And therefore in as much as the ſpiritual influence and operation of ſuch an Ordinance upon the heart of a man when he comes to age, which he received in his minority (as touching his perſonal intereſt in it) does depend upon his knowledg of the thing done, as to matter of fact; therefore by how much more evident and indubitable ſatisfaction hereabout was exhibited in and by that durable ſign in the fleſh, which was made by Circumciſion, above what is to be had by any means to aſſure perſons at age of their being baptized in their Infancy; by ſo much the more did Infant-Circumciſion anſwer the ends of that Ordinance, above what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm can be ſo much as ſuppoſed to anſwer the ends of this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer yet further, That the end of Circumciſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though adminiſtred to Infants, was better attained, then the end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm can be when it is ſo applyed; becauſe much of the benefit of Circumciſion did accrue to the circumciſed upon the work done, without reſpect to any inward qualification or endowment; whereas the benefit of Baptiſm does not accrue meerly upon the work done, but is ſuſpended upon the knowledg, faith, &amp;c. of him who is baptized. The Righteouſneſs of the Law (of which Circumciſion was a principal part) ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>The man that doth thoſe things ſhal live by them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, by way of contradiſtinction from the voyce of the Goſpel, or the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. And again, <hi>The Law is not of Faith, (i. e.</hi> the Promiſes, many of them at leaſt, were not ſuſpended on mens believing,) <hi>but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them, Gal.</hi> 3.12. Hereupon that Miniſtration is called <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the letter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. the Ordinances thereof <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, and ſuch as did not make perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience, Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10. The Apoſtle, to ſhew wherein the Goſpel or new Covenant exceeds the Law or old one, ſaith, that according to this <hi>God puts his Laws in the minds of men, and writes them in their hearts, Heb.</hi> 8.10. which implies, that he did not do ſo under the Old Teſtament; or at leaſt but very little comparatively. Again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110914:23"/>and truth:</hi> implying, that thither-unto, or until then, they had not ſo worſhipped him; or at leaſt, that there was but little of that found under the Legal Diſpenſation. And, according to the nature of this Miniſtration, children voyd of underſtanding and faith, were capable of holy things, as Circumciſion and Paſſover, and the like, and conſequently of the ends and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of them in part, upon a literal adminiſtration and reception of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.44, 48.</p>
               <p>But the caſe is far otherwiſe now under the Goſpel, which is the Miniſtration of the Spirit, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) It is not the work done, but the manner of doing of it in knowledg faith, and fear of the Lord, that entitles men unto the benefit and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Goſpel-Ordinances: for ſo the Apoſtle affirms concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptiſm it ſelf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. when he ſays, <hi>that it ſaves us now,</hi> as the Ark did ſome in the days of <hi>Noah: not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the putting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> not by the external letter of the Ordinance,) <hi>but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God: i.e.</hi> when accompanyed with ſuch a frame of mind and conſcience, as does anſwer God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments of Grace in that Ordinance. So again, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. when the Apoſtle ſaith, that they <hi>were buryed with Chriſt in Baptiſm,</hi> and that they were therein alſo <hi>riſen with him,</hi> yet he ſays that thus they were <hi>by the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed Chriſt from the dead:</hi> meaning, ſuch a faith, as was produced by the operation of God, or elſe ſuch as had the operation of God in raiſing up Chriſt for its object: however, it was by the interveniency of this Faith, that they became both buryed and riſen with Chriſt in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now Infants, as they are not capable of acting this Faith, or making this anſwer of a good Conſcience, ſo they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thoſe bleſſings and benefits intended by God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; in as much as he hath ſuſpended the donation thereof upon theſe, in conjunction with Baptiſm. And where any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect depends upon the taking place of more cauſes then one (as it does in the caſe in hand) it is not any one of thoſe cauſes alone that will produce that effect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> How ever the ends of Circumciſion were attainable, though adminiſtred to Infants in thoſe reſpects before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110914:23"/>with their fellows, yet doubtleſs the Ordinance it ſelf was ſo much the leſs ſpiritual, and ſo much the more weak, and ſavoring of the Legal Miniſtration, and ſuited to the then childiſh condition of the Church, becauſe adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was made to Infants. This, I conceive, might eaſily be made out from ſeveral of thoſe rational principles conſonant to the Scripture, upon and from which I have already evinced Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be more ſpiritual, profitable, and edifying, when admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to men profeſſing the Faith, then when applyed to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Therefore doubtleſs, what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>the Commandment</hi> in general (meaning the <hi>Law,</hi> which, as he ſays, <hi>made nothing perfect</hi>) how that <hi>it is diſanulled for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs of it, Hebr.</hi> 7.18, 19. may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to comprehend even this part of the Commandment alſo, which enjoyned an Ordinance, one or more, to be adminiſtred to little children. And how ever ſuch a mean, low way and method of enjoying Ordinances, as was accommodated to the capacity of babes, was not uncomely whileſt the Church was in the condition of children, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3.) no more then it is for a child, whileſt he is a child, to ſpeak and act as a child; yet to retain this poor, and low, and barren way of adminiſtring a Goſpel-Ordinance to Infants, now the Church is raiſed, both in capacity and adminiſtration to its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition, is as incongruous and uncomely, as it is for one ſtill to ſpeak and act as a child, when he is become a man. By this time I hope it appears, that there is not the ſame reaſon why Baptiſm adminiſtred to Infants ſhould reach the ends thereof, as there was why Circumciſion, though applyed to Infants formerly, ſhould attain its end. For the nature of the two Ordinances differ, the terms of their Adminiſtration dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the reſpective capacities of the Church then, and the Church now, differ: and according to that rule in Logick. <hi>Where the things themſelves differ, there the reaſons of thoſe things differ alſo.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. MY next Argument ſhall be taken from the different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the two Miniſtrations of the Old and New Teſtaments, as rendering Infant-Baptiſm, in that preciſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it as applyed to Infants, diſagreeable to the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, but withall more correſpondent with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Law: Therefore I thus further argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Infant-Baptiſm be diſagreeable to the Ministration of the New Teſtament, then Infants ought not to be baptized:</hi> The reaſon hereof is, becauſe ſo far as either this or any other way or practice does comply with the Legal Miniſtration, and diſagree with the Evangelical, ſo far it does croſs or oppoſe the deſign of God, in changing the Miniſtration of the Law, for that of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and conſequently carries in it a ſpirit of antipathy againſt the very ſpirit of the Goſpel Miniſtration. This, if it were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident of it ſelf, might receive abundant confirmation from ſuch Scriptures as theſe, and what might fairly and plainly be deduced from them: <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.9, 10, 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.1. But I preſume of every mans plenary ſatisfaction as to this: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Infant-Baptiſm is diſagreeable to the Ministration of the New Teſtament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſſumption.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The truth hereof, in the firſt place, is conſpicuous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by what hath been made good in our former Argument: For there we proved Baptiſm, as adminiſtred to Infants, leſs edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the ſeveral ends of it, then when adminiſtred unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and if leſs edifying, then the more ſuitable and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Miniſtration of the Law, which was a Miniſtration of leſs light and edification; and to the ſame proportion, diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, which is a Miniſtration of a greater light, and a more rich edification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I might, in the ſecond place, well ſuppoſe Infant-Baptiſm to ſavor ſtrongly of the Legal Miniſtration, becauſe the principal Arguments, produced in defence thereof, are ſuch as do ariſe out of, and are deducted from, the example of Infant-Circumciſion, a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110914:24"/>principal part of the Legal Miniſtration, and from that analogy and proportion that is ſuppoſed to be between them: and not only ſo, but likewiſe becauſe ſuch Arguments and Pleas tend to draw down this part of the Goſpel-Miniſtration, as applicable to Infants, unto the line and level of the Legal. For ſuch Arguments, and the thing argued, what are they elſe but ſuch which are <hi>after the rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt, i. e.</hi> ſuch as are according to the Miniſtration of the Law which was by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Goſpel which is by Chriſt: of which the Apoſtle warns the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to take heed, as ſuch by which they were in danger of being deceived and ſpoyled: <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoyl you through Philoſophy and vain deceit (i. e.</hi> through Philoſophical and deceitful reaſonings, which are) <hi>after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</hi> Now thoſe reaſonings may be ſaid to be <hi>after the rudiments of the world,</hi> not only which tend to commend the obſervation and practiſe of thoſe rudiments in all the particulars of the letter of them, but alſo when ſuch Arguments and Pleas, for ſuch or ſuch a practice, be derived from, and grounded only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe rudiments, and not on the Goſpel. And, 2. When they tend to promote a way or practice which anſwers the nature of thoſe rudiments in ſome one or more particulars proper to them, though otherwiſe not the ſame literally and in all reſpects. For ſo Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> though he were not ſpecifically ſuch another Prieſt in all reſpects, but ſuch which held ſome <hi>ſimilitude</hi> with him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.15. Now that thoſe Arguments for Infant-Baptiſm, which are as the Axletree upon which the Controverſie on that ſide turns, and as the warp running all along that piece of diſcourſe; that theſe Arguments may be ſaid to be <hi>after the rudiments of the world,</hi> or one of the rudiments of the world, to wit, Circumciſion of Infants, and that in both theſe reſpects before mentioned, is eaſie to conceive. For are not the principal Pleas for Infant-Baptiſm derived from, and founded on the Circumciſion of Infants under the Law? And do they not tend to promote a way and practice now under the Goſpel, of adminiſtering an holy Ordinance unto Infants? which for ought appears to the contrary, was proper and peculiar to that Adminiſtration of the Law?</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:110914:25"/>
               <p>Nor does that diſſolve the ſtrength of what I have now ſaid, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> which uſually is objected in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That both our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles vindicate and aſſert practices under the Goſpel, from the examples of practices under the Law: as the <hi>Diſciples gathering ears of corn on the Sabbath,</hi> from <hi>Davids</hi> eating <hi>the ſhewbread;</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> killing of Sacrifices in the Temple on the Sabbath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3, 4, 5.

It does not appear, that men of private ſpirits, wanting that infallible guidance of the Holy Ghoſt which Chriſt and his Apoſtles had, may uſe like liberty as they did in this behalf. Nay, hath not the preſumption thus to do, been the ſluce through which very many Popiſh Superſtitions have firſt entred into the World? as ſuppoſing them to hold an analogical and equitable proportion with many the Jewiſh Cuſtoms?</p>
               <p>But, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. I anſwer further, That things differ much in the caſes produced and compared; For, 1. Though Chriſt and the Apoſtles did both back and illuſtrate their Doctrine and Precepts from inſtances and examples of things under the Law, yet they never made theſe examples the ſole ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof, but theſe are ſtill built upon that authority they had from God otherwiſe. As Chriſt, in that caſe now object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, over and above his allegation from the Law, interpoſes his own authority as more conſiderable; <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.6. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that in this place is one greater then the Temple:</hi> and more plainly, Verſ. 8. <hi>For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.</hi> And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in the other caſe, he firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally pleads his Apoſtolical Authority, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle? am I not free? have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? are you not my work in the Lord? If I be not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſs I am to you; for the ſeal of mine Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are ye in the Lord:</hi> but after he hath done this, he then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to illuſtrate what he pleads, by that which he brings out of the Law, Verſ. 8.9, 10. and <hi>in fine,</hi> does bottom the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the appointment or ordination of God, for ſo he ſays
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110914:25"/>Verſ. 14. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, ſhould live of the Gospel.</hi> 2. The things which both Chriſt and the Apoſtle, in the caſes objected, plead from examples out of the Law, were not meerly and barely inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and poſitive, but of a moral conſideration, and ſo of a more ready perception and deduction from thoſe examples. The Diſciples gathering of Corn on the Sabbath, could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a breach but of a ceremonial precept, and yet it was in order to preſerve their lives, health, and ſtrength, a thing enjoyned by a moral precept, which is ſuperior to that which is but ceremonial: in which caſe the Phariſees might eaſily have ſatisfied themſelves from the examples produced by Chriſt; as he ſays, <hi>If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs, Matth.</hi> 12.7. That there was alſo a moral equity in the nature of the thing, <hi>viz. that they who preach the Gospel, ſhould live of the Gospel,</hi> (another thing that was ſaid to be pleaded from examples in the Law) appears plainly; becauſe the Apoſtle ſuppoſes a like equity in this, as there is, <hi>that he that goeth a warfare ſhould have his charges born</hi> by them for whom he fights; or as there is that he who <hi>planteth a vineyard ſhould eat of the fruit thereof, or that feedeth a flock ſhould eat of the milk thereof,</hi> or that <hi>the laborer ſhould have his hire,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>But now Infant-Baptiſm hath not any expreſs authority of Chriſt or his Apoſtles to back it, or any moral equity in and of it ſelf diſcernable to commend it; in both which reſpects it differs from the inſtances and examples objected, and fails of that confirmation it catched at by them. And ſuch a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the nature of things, cannot but make a like difference in thoſe proper inferences that may be drawn from them. It's true indeed, it is ordinary to aſſert ſuch things as are plain parts of the Goſpel, from the prefigurations and predictions of the Law, (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. Epiſtle <hi>Heb. &amp;c.</hi>) but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert any thing from the Ceremonies of the Law, which hath no footing in the Goſpel, is doubtleſs that which is after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt; which I ſuppoſe verily to be the caſe of Infant-Baptiſm, when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110914:26"/>it is pleaded from Infants Circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing, by which it may appear that Infant-Baptiſm is not agreeable to the Goſpel-Miniſtration, is, in that it differs from it in this property of it, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is <hi>a Miniſtration of the Spirit;</hi> for ſo it's called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. It's the Miniſtration of the Spirit in two reſpects: 1. Becauſe in and by this Miniſtration the Spirit is given unto men, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.2, 5. 2. Becauſe the worſhip and ſervice which God receives from men under it, is, or ought to be more ſpiritual then that was under the Law; in both which reſpects Infant-Baptiſm will be found diſagreeable to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Baptiſm, as an Ordinance of the New Teſtament, and part of the Goſpel. Miniſtration, when duly adminiſtred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, does contribute towards their receiving of the Spirit, in reſpect of a greater preſence and operation thereof, then till then ordinarily hath been enjoyed by them who are thus baptized, may appear from the promiſe of God made in that behalf, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt &amp;c.</hi> And that this was not particular and peculiar to thoſe perſons unto whom <hi>Peter</hi> then ſpake theſe words, but that the ſame promiſe is made to all, in all ages, that ſhall repent and be baptized, is evident by that which follows in the next Verſe, whereby the Apoſtle doth aſſure them of the remiſſion of their ſins, and their reception of the Holy Ghoſt, in caſe they did repent, and were baptized, upon this ground; becauſe the promiſe of God, to wit, upon the terms before mentioned, was made to them, and to their children, and not to them only, but alſo to thoſe afar off, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and generation, even as many of them or their children, or others afar off, as whom the Lord our God ſhould ſo call, <hi>viz.</hi> by Repentance and Baptiſm. And it is very like, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that proximity or neerneſs of relation that is between this Ordinance of Baptiſm by water, and this Baptiſm of the Spirit, that mens being <hi>born of water and of the Spirit, (Joh.</hi> 3.5.) and <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are coupled together in Scripture, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And it is not unlike neither, but that the Spirits deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110914:26"/>upon Chriſt immediately upon his being baptized (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16.) might have this inſtruction in it, to teach all thoſe that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly be baptized with water as he was, to expect a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and preſence of the Spirit, then before had been vouchſafed to them.</p>
               <p>But now that it is not reaſonable to expect, that any ſuch effect ſhould be produced by Infants being baptized, is evident upon this ground, becauſe the gift of the Spirit is ſtill made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to follow the act of mens beleving the Goſpel, (of which act Infants are uncapable,) <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. And therefore when I affirm, as before, That the gift of the Spirit, or ſome greater meaſure of the Spirit, is promiſed upon Baptiſm duly received, I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if I meant, that this promiſe is made to any meerly and barely upon their being baptized, but to their Baptiſm in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with their believing and repenting, for ſo it is in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized, &amp;c. and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> The promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not made, either to Repentance or Baptiſm ſingly, but to both in conjunction. So that although Baptiſm be to be received with an eye to the promiſe of the Spirit, and under an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a greater preſence thereof, yet by ſuch only who are under that qualification of believing; for where things are promiſed upon ſeveral conditions, or upon condition of ſeveral things in conjunction, it is not the performance of one of thoſe conditions alone, that can put a man into a due and well-grounded expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>That Infants are in no preſent or actual capacity of believing whil'ſt ſuch, is evident upon this ground, becauſe they have not the uſe and exerciſe of underſtanding, knowledg, or reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can actually believe. For faith ſuppoſes an actual knowledg in him who does believe, of theſe two things; 1. A notion or knowledg of the thing, matter, record, or teſtimony, to be believed; and, 2. A notion or knowledg of him who is to be believed, or who is the Author of that doctrine or ſaying which is the ſubject matter of Faith; as namely, That he is ſuch an one as may be credited in what he ſays. Theſe things are clear from theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Romans</hi> 10.14, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9 3, 6.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110914:27"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. That Infants have no ſuch knowledg as to make any Judgment upon either perſon or thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as touching either the goodneſs or badneſs of the one, or the probability or improbability of the other, appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.39. <hi>Your little ones, which ye ſaid ſhould be a prey, and your children which in that day had no knowledg between good and evil, they ſhall go in, &amp;c. Iſai.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>If Infants then be in no preſent capacity to believe, and without believing in no capacity to receive the Spirit, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That Infants, whileſt ſuch, are in no due capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Baptiſm in order to their receiving the Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that Baptiſm adminiſtred to them, is diſagreeable to the Goſpel-Miniſtration, as it is the Miniſtration of the Spirit; where as the Baptiſm of Believers is moſt commodiouſly ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto.</p>
               <p>Nor can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed here, that ſuch a notion as this will ſalve this fore, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm may be received by Infants in order to their receiving the Spirit when they come to believe, and ſo their Baptiſm be agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Miniſtration as it is a Miniſtration of the Spirit, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be received in Infancy; Becauſe Baptiſm hath no influence this way as it is a work done, in which reſpect only Infants are capable of it, but as it is done, ſubmitted to, and taken up out of faith, and in obedience to God, as hath been already proved before in part, and will be further confirmed afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Infant-Baptiſm is diſagreeable to the Goſpel-Miniſtration as it is the Miniſtration of the Spirit, in this reſpect alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> as it requires all Worſhippers, in all acts of worſhip, in all the Ordinances of this Miniſtration, <hi>to worſhip God in Spirit,</hi> with the mind, in faith and fear of the Lord. That theſe are the terms of the Goſpel-Miniſtration, appears from <hi>Job.</hi> 4.23, 24. with other places cited formerly upon ſomewhat like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, upon which account I may ſpare further inſiſting on them here. He that makes uſe of a Goſpel-Ordinance, and does not diſcern in ſome meaſure the nature, tendency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it, contracts ſin and guilt to himſelf thereby, as is moſt clear in the caſe of the Supper of the Lord; he that in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110914:27"/>eating and drinking <hi>does not diſcern the Lords body, eats and drinks Judgment to himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. And becauſe this qualification of diſcerning is not found in Children, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not admitted to this Ordinance. And how they ſhould be uncapable of this Ordinance in this reſpect, and yet capable of Baptiſm, I underſtand not, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they both repreſent the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. both relate to the great benefit of remiſſion of ſins by him, and tend to ſerve the important intereſt of men thereabout, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.28. Since they both then travel with the ſame bleſſing in the main; how comes it to paſs that the bleſſing of the one accrues not to the receiver but by his diſcerning the mind of God in it? and yet the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the other does, without any ſuch diſcerning, if that were true which ſome imagine? Certainly if plain Scriptures will ſatisfie hereabout, they do inform us, that it is by means of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>the anſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> that Baptiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes beneficial as to its ends, as well as the Supper by a ſpiritual diſcerning as to its, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. But I ſhall not inſiſt again upon that which I have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. In a word, the whole Miniſtration is denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Faith, (<hi>Galat.</hi> 3.23, 25.) becauſe Faith, from firſt to laſt, from one end of it to the other, is to ſteer all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs under it on mans part, to act every ſervice, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company every Ordinance, to receive every bleſſing, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all actions acceptable, and to make all parts of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial.</p>
               <p>Where this qualification therefore is known to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is in Infants, certainly there Baptiſm cannot be applyed without an apparent breach of the Laws and Rules of this ſpiritual Miniſtration. And thus alſo have I made good the premiſſes of this third Argument; the Concluſion will follow of it ſelf without help, &amp;c.</p>

            <div n="4" type="argument">

               <head>AROUM. IIII.</head>
               <p>MY next Argument ſhall be this: <hi>If none ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but ſuch who appear voluntarily willing to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in obedience to God, then Infants ought not be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe Infants Baptiſm cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to proceed from any willingneſs in them to obey God therein, they being no wiſe voluntary or active, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſive therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But none ought to be baptized,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſſumption.</note> 
                  <hi>but ſuch who appear voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to be baptized in obedience to God.</hi> The reaſon hereof is this, becauſe without this obediential willingneſs, Baptiſm will be unprofitable and fruitleſs to them: and where we know the good of Baptiſm is not to be attained, there it is not to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; for in caſe we ſhould, it would be a profanation of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, a taking of Gods Name in vain: Though the ſowing of ſeed be never ſo neceſſary, yet it would be no mans wiſdom, but folly, to ſow in ſuch a ground, or at ſuch a ſeaſon, which he knows will render his ſeed fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>That there is no reaſon to expect otherwiſe, but that Baptiſm ſhould be unprofitable to all ſuch who do not take it up volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, willingly, and in obedience to God, appears upon this account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe now under the Goſpel, this is the ſtanding Rule or Law between Duties and Rewards, between the uſing of holy Ordinances, and the benefit that comes by them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be done, and Ordinances performed willingly, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. where the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of his preaching the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>If I do this thing willingly, I have a reward.</hi> This ſaying of the Apoſtle, though it were uttered upon one particular occaſion, yet doubtleſs it reaches all perſons and all duties; If any man do any duty willingly, as unto God, he ſhall have his reward. But as Affirmatives uſe to include their Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by way of implication, ſo it is here; If I do it not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I have no reward: For ſo the particle <hi>IF,</hi> imports the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon which the reward is to be received or not received: and you will ſpoyl the ſence of the place, if you ſuppoſe, that if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110914:28"/>the Apoſtle did the thing he there ſpeaks of, he ſhould receive a reward, whether he did it willingly or no. Again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> This alſo, though it were ſpoken upon a particular occaſion (as many the great Doctrines of the Scriptures were,) yet it is a general propoſition, which reaches even all duties. If there be firſt a willing mind, that is, an obedientious diſpoſition God ward; and this willingneſs of mind, and obediential diſpoſition, is that, both which puts a man upon doing his duty according to that ability he hath, and which alſo renders the ſame acceptable and rewardable with God. Here again this conditional particle <hi>IF, If there be firſt a willing mind,</hi> muſt needs imply, that if this willing mind be wanting, the man is not accepted, his action not rewarded, though he do the thing: For ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame duty of giving, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. ſaith, <hi>Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing:</hi> Still teaching us, that if there be an inward principle of a willing compliance with the Will of God wanting in any action, which in it ſelf is good, and commanded of God; yet for that very cauſe it becomes unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to him that does it, in which reſpect we affirm Baptiſm of Infants unprofitable to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Promiſes made unto duty, or upon condition of duty, are rewards of that obedience which is yielded to God in diſcharge of duty, when they are fulfilled thereupon. Now it is no wiſe proper to ſay, or rational to ſuppoſe, that God rewards his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, man, for that wherein he is only paſſive, they being ſuch actions which we call moral, and which proceed from the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Will governed by a divine Law, that are rewardable by God. And therefore, unleſs Baptiſm be ſubmitted unto willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in obedience to God, which cannot be ſuppoſed in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; the good things annexed thereto, by way of promiſory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of ſuch obedience, cannot upon any good ground be expected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have proved before in another Argument, That now, under the Goſpel-Miniſtration, there is no benefit comes, either by Baptiſm, or any other Ordinance, but by means of his Faith
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110914:29"/>who partakes thereof; <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, (Hebr.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>i. e.</hi> in any ſervice to approve ones ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; <hi>For whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. It then the benefit we ſpeak of comes not without Faith, then neither does it accrue without that willingneſs of mind and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientious diſpoſition God-ward we ſpeak of, becauſe it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible this ſhould be ſeparate from Faith; I mean, a living active Faith, which is the Faith of Gods acceptation: and therefore, to believe, and to obey, are in Scripture frequently put one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accordingly indifferently ſo tranſlated, as appears by the double readings.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here again anſwer the caſe of Infant-Circumciſion, which poſſibly may again riſe up in the minds of ſome againſt what hath been now layd down in this Argument alſo, but ſhall refer the Reader, for ſatisfaction herein, to what hath been already done about that ſubject in anſwer to a former Objection, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſufficient at this turn alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not proceed further to levy more Arguments to ſerve in this Controverſie (unleſs occaſionally) though many more, of like import with the former, might perhaps readily be formed and drawn up, as judging theſe already inſiſted on abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to detect the vanity of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall I apply my ſelf to anſwer thoſe many contrary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are wont to be muſtered up in defence of Infant-Baptiſm; not becauſe I count them, or any of them, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, or of hard or difficult attempt; but partly becauſe in thoſe Arguments I have produced, there is a ground or foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on layd of anſwering all contrary reaſonings, and which is of eaſie application this way: and partly becauſe ſome of the chiefeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on that ſide, have been produced already Objection-wiſe, and received their anſwer: and partly likewiſe becauſe this hath been ſufficiently done by other hands: and laſtly for brevity ſake, as perceiving copious diſcourſes hereabout to be burdenſom.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is one Argument which ſeems to be much taking with ſome, which as it is of a later invention then others, ſo perhaps hath not received ſuch anſwer and refutation as others have; therefore as to this, I ſhall give in ſome what by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:110914:29"/>
               <p>The Argument is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the love of God to perſons be the firſt and original ground of their being capable of Baptiſm, then Infants are capable of Baptiſm:</hi> The reaſon of this conſequence is, becauſe Infants are in the love and favor of God, in as much as God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that ſin, of which they were guilty in and by <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo put them into a condition of Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the love of God to perſons is the original or firſt ground of their being capable of Baptiſm.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſſumption.</note> To make good this minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, two things are alledged, 1. That the reaſon why Faith is neceſſary in perſons who have not been baptized in their Infancy, to render them capable of Baptiſm, is, becauſe it is that mean by which thoſe that are to adminiſter Baptiſm come to know that they are in the love and favor of God: and if ſuch a thing could be known without ſuch a profeſſion of Faith, as it may in the caſe of Infants, ſuch a profeſſion of Faith would not be neceſſary in order to ſuch an admiſſion. 2. That it was upon this ground that Chriſt himſelf was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Baptiſm; for otherwiſe he had no ſuch Faith as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of men to render them capable of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> a Faith in God touching the remiſſion of ſins through Chriſt; but as he was a perſon beloved of God, upon this account Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm did belong to him, and accordingly was adminiſtred. And yet that Chriſt did not receive Baptiſm upon any terms extraordinary, though he himſelf was a perſon extraordinary, but upon the ſame terms upon which others do, and ought to receive it, appears by this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that even his Baptiſm was adminiſtred and received, in conformity to a standing Rule or Law of Righteouſneſs, common to others as well as to him; for ſo he himſelf ſaith to <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> ſpeaking of his own Baptiſm; <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs, Matt.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Before I come to anſwer particularly to this Argument, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I ſhall deſire theſe two things may be obſerved by the way: 1. That this Argument contradicts another that is wont to be employed in this ſervice, to wit, that the promiſe of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to children of believing Parents, and therefore Baptiſm: by which Baptiſm is reſtrained to ſuch Infants onely as are the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110914:30"/>children of believing Parents: But by this Argument, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is made to appertain to all Infants whatſoever, whether they be children of believing or unbelieving Parents, becauſe it ſuppoſes all Infants to be in the love of God in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned reſpect: and therefore if this be true, the other muſt be falſe in its reſtrained ſence; and contrarily, if the other true, this falſe: ſo that you ſee the witneſſes do no better agree in their evidence in this behalf, then the falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes did, that came againſt Chriſt, in their teſtimony. 2. This Argument, if it were good, would render, not onely all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants capable of Baptiſm, But all men likewiſe, whether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Pagan, becauſe they are beloved of God in ſuch a ſence as it's ſaid Infants are, to wit, in having that ſin, of which they were guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> remitted to them. For if that ſin were remitted to them in their Infancy, ſurely that act of grace and pardon is not recalled when they come to be men, in as much as we no where find in Scripture, that any mens periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is at all charged upon that ſin which they were guilty of in <hi>Adam,</hi> but upon their own voluntary neglect of Grace, and on their actual tranſgreſſion. And therefore if it be abſurd (as I ſuppoſe it will be granted to be) to argue all mens capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Baptiſm from this ground, which yet is common to all men as well as Infants, why ſhould it be thought any other then abſurd likewiſe, to infer Infants capability of Baptiſm from the ſame ground? <hi>Since in things which are the ſame, or like, there is the ſame or like Reaſon and Judgment,</hi> as <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſer to the Argument; I do deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the major Propoſition; I do deny that it therefore follows, that Infants are capable of Baptiſm, though it ſhould be granted, that the love of God is the original ground of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering perſons capable thereof. And the reaſon of this denyal is taken from that difference which is between the original ground of perſons capability of Baptiſm, and the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ground thereof: for however the love of God be the ground of all Diſpenſations of good to the Creature, yet it is not ſom the ſelf ſame reſpect; but as it exhibits it ſelf in one Diſpenſation of it in one reſpect, ſo in another Diſpenſation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110914:30"/>thereof it exhibits it ſelf upon other terms and reſpects. And therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh of the love of God as it is the ground of Baptiſm. The love of God then is to be conſidered, either, 1. In the whole entire ſum or body of it, generally and indefinitely conſidered, as comprehending and encloſing in it all particular Diſpenſations of Grace towards the Creature; or elſe, 2. As it exerts or puts forth it ſelf in thoſe particular Diſpenſations themſelves. The love of God in the former ſence, though it be the ground of all particular acts of Grace, and ſo of that alſo which appertains to Baptiſm, yet it is no ſound way of reaſoning, to conclude perſons to be in an immediate capacity of Baptiſm, becauſe they are in the love of God under this general conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. For upon the ſame ground one might as well argue In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be ſtrong Chriſtians, or fit to be choſen Paſtors, Teachers, or Deacons, as to argue them capable of Baptiſm, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in theſe capacities by vertue of the love of God to them. And yet who ſees not how abſurd it would be to reaſon thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the love of God to perſons be the original ground which renders them capable of being choſen into the office of Paſtor, Teacher, or Deacon, then Infants are capable of being choſen into theſe Offices, becauſe they are in the love of God: But the love of God is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If the love of God to perſons be the original ground of rendering them capable of the denomination of ſtrong Chriſtians, then Infants are capable of the denomination of ſtrong Chriſtians, becauſe they are in the love and favor of God: But, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, to put another caſe like unto theſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If life be the original ground or cauſe why perſons are capable of ſpeaking, then Infants are capable of ſpeaking, becauſe they have life: But life is the orignal ground or cauſe why perſons are capable of ſpeaking,</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>By the light then of theſe inſtances, the invalidity, indeed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of concluding Infants to be capable of Baptiſm, be cauſe they are in that love and favor of God, may you ſee be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned.</p>
               <p>If then we would come to argue ſteadily, ſo as to conclude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons capability of Baptiſm from the love of God to them, we muſt conſider the love of God under that particular and preciſe notion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110914:31"/>of it, by which perſons are put into an immediate, not remote ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Baptiſm. For though it is true, that that love of God, which is vouchſafed Infants in the pardon of that ſin that devolved it ſelf on them from <hi>Adam,</hi> does put them into a remote capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city both of Baptiſm and all other conſequential acts of grace, which are vouchſafed men upon their believing and diligent and faithful improvement of all means and opportunities of grace, &amp;c. yet it does not put them into an immediate capacity of theſe, until they do believe, and have improved thoſe means and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, upon condition of which ſuch additional and progreſſionary acts of grace are promiſed and ſuſpended; no more then a childs ability to read his Horn-book, or Primmer, puts him into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of underſtanding his Grammar.</p>
               <p>That the Diſpenſation of Gods grace and love is made to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in one reſpect, and to perſons in an immediate capacity of Baptiſm in another; and that that act of grace which is vouchſafed Infants in the pardon of that firſt ſin, &amp;c. does not put them into an immediate capacity of Baptiſm, appears upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that act of grace, or diſpenſation of Gods love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Baptiſm does appropriately belong, is that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted and put forth in the pardon of mens actual tranſgreſſions, and this too not without their repenting or believing; whereas that act of grace, of which Infants partake, is ſuch as is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them in the pardon of original ſin only, and this too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their repenting and believing, meerly upon the account of the death of Chriſt. That that act, or thoſe acts of grace, unto which Baptiſm appropriately does belong, is the pardon of ſin upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſuch other acts of grace as are concommitant and conſequential thereunto, appears plainly by this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Baptiſm is called (according to the nature of it, and the intent of God in its inſtitution) <hi>the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. That is, that Baptiſm which is to be received upon mens repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; or that Baptiſm, in and by which men profeſs they expect remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins in the way of repentance: or becauſe the reception of which Baptiſm proceeds from a principle of repentance; or elſe becauſe God doth therein authentically aſſure men of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110914:31"/>of their ſins upon their repentance. Take it which way you will, it proves this, That Baptiſm is converſant about, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient unto that act of Gods grace and love, which is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed men in the pardon of their ſins upon their repentance: and if ſo, then is it irrelative to the grace of God in the pardon of Infants ſin, which is vouchſafed them without, and before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance takes place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of God is the immediate ground of Baptiſm, ſo far only as it relates too, or is effective of the good of men in Baptiſm; for the reception of Baptiſm is not otherwiſe to be eſteemed an effect of Gods love, then as the good and benefit of men is concerned therein: That which Chriſts ſpeaks of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, how that it <hi>was made for man, Mark</hi> 2.27. <hi>i. e.</hi> for the good of man, is true of Baptiſm, and every other Ordinance and Inſtitution of God. In as much then as Baptiſm is not otherwiſe beneficial unto any, but by means of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>anſwer of a good Conſcience;</hi> and in as much alſo, as that Infants are not under this capacity of means, both which I have formerly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved; therefore it follows undenyably, that God does not love Infants upon any ſuch terms as he does thoſe unto whom he commends and communicates his love in and by Baptiſm, and conſequently, that the love which God bears to Infants, puts them into no immediate capacity of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The extent of Gods love to Infants, ſo far as is pretended in the reaſon of the conſequence of the major Propoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts onely in the pardon of original ſin, and the putting them into a condition of Salvation by Chriſt; all which love of God they are inveſted with before ever Baptiſm can be applyed to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the love of God in this reſpect, is not conditional, nor does depend upon the action of any creature, or application of any means, but ſolely upon the attonement which Chriſt hath made on that behalf: and therefore Baptiſm lies out of the verge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs or circumference of the love of God as enjoyed by Infants, and contributes neither leſs nor more in that diſpenſation of Gods love to them; in which reſpect alſo Baptiſm is irrelative to the love of God in that preciſe conſideration of it, in which it is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Infants.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is alledged by way of proof of the minor Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110914:32"/>1. That the reaſon why Faith is neceſſary in perſons who have not been baptized in their Infancy, to render them capable of Baptiſm, is, becauſe it is that mean by which thoſe that are to admit them to Baptiſm come to know that they are in the love of God; and that if ſuch a thing could be known without ſuch a profeſſion of Faith, as it may in the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that then ſuch a profeſſion would not be neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſuch an admiſſion.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer likewiſe; 1. That a profeſſion of Faith in ſuch perſons, to render them admitable to Baptiſm, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inform thoſe that admit them touching Gods love to them in any reſpect whatſoever, for this may be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a profeſſion; but in relation to their knowing them to be in the love and favor of God in that particular reſpect and determinate conſideration, which renders men immediately capable of Baptiſm; in this reſpect ſuch a profeſſion of Faith is neceſſary, becauſe without it the love of God to them upon ſuch terms is not knowable, and conſequently they not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Baptiſm, as was before proved: by which Infants, as touching their capability of Baptiſm, are clearly excluded. 2. The profeſſion of Faith is neceſſary in the caſe in hand, for other cauſes then meerly to inform thoſe that admit perſons to Baptiſm, of their being in the favor of God in general whom they do admit, and that is to let them know that ſuch are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſeveral ends and benefits of Baptiſm, and ſo meet for Baptiſm it ſelf; becauſe unleſs they have reaſon to conceive that they have Faith, they can have no reaſon to conceive them in a preſent capacity of the ends and benefits of Baptiſm, and ſo not of Baptiſm it ſelf, in as much as theſe are ſuſpended upon Faith, as hath already been evinced.</p>
               <p>Whereas in the ſecond place it is ſaid, that it was upon this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gods loving him, that Chriſt himſelf was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Baptiſm, and not his Faith, in as much as he had no ſuch Faith as is required of men to render them capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to wit, a Faith in God touching the remiſſion of ſins through Chriſt; and that yet Chriſt did not receive Baptiſm upon any terms extraordinary, but upon the ſame terms as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, in as much as it was in conformity to a ſtanding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110914:32"/>Law of Righteouſneſs common to others as well as him:</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That this reaſon is built upon a miſtaken ground, as ſuppoſing Chriſt to have no ſuch Faith as might render him capable of Baptiſm, at leaſt ſuch as is required of other men in order thereunto. For Chriſt had the ſame Faith which is required of all other perſons in that caſe. For what Faith was required of other men to render them capable of Baptiſm, ſave this? <hi>viz.</hi> To believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God? For ſo when the Eunuch demanded of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſaying, <hi>See here is water, what hindreth me to be baptized? then Philip anſwered and ſaid, If thou beleeveſt with all thine heart thou mayſt: and he anſwered Philip again, and ſaid, I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God:</hi> upon which confeſſion <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him, as counting it ſummarily to contain the expreſſion of that believing with all the heart, which he before had ſet as the condition of his admiſsion thereunto; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was none other then the Faith of the Goſpel, and the common form of Believers confeſsion: <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.69. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20. And I hope none that own the Scriptures, will deny Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have this Faith, in as much as it was his own doctrine which he taught, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.43. The truth is, Chriſt himſelf had a Faith in God his Father, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.8. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.43.) and did continue in his Fathers love in the way of obedience to his commands, as other the children of God do, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.10. And therefore well may it be ſaid indeed, that Chriſt received Baptiſm upon the ſame terms as others did, at leaſt in ſeveral reſpects, and that in conformity to the ſame ſtanding Law of Righteouſneſs (to wit, the inſtitution of God) common to others as well as to him. For doubtleſs this was the Will of God hereabout, <hi>viz.</hi> That at what time men undertake publiquely to profeſs and aſſert the Goſpel unto the World in word and deed, then and at that time they are to take up the Ordinance of Baptiſm; as the examples of perſons, whoſe Baptiſm is recorded in the new Teſtament, do abundantly witneſs. And therefore Chriſt himſelf, when he alſo is coming forth into the world, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and publiſh the Goſpel which he had received from the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110914:33"/>Father, he alſo makes a dedication of himſelf unto this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by the ſolemnity of Baptiſm, as others did, and ought to do.</p>
               <p>And we might hence well frame an Argument againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, in ſtead of wreſting it, as a witneſs for it, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt Ieſus his being baptized at that ſeaſon, and upon that occaſion, when he began to profeſs and publiſh the Gospel, and not before, was in conformity to a Law of Righteouſneſs in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; then thoſe that are baptized, who yet make no ſuch profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Infants are, are not baptized in conformity to that Law of Righteouſneſs:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſt Ieſus his being baptized at that ſeaſon, and upon that occaſion, when he began to profeſs and publiſh the Gospel, and not before, was in conformity to a Law of Righteouſneſs in this behalf; therefore thoſe that are baptized, as Infants are, who yet make no ſuch profeſſion, are not baptized in conformity to that Law of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which adds weight to the minor Propoſition in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (which I ſuppoſe is the only thing that will be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in it) is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt his fulfilling a Law of Righteouſneſs in his Baptiſm, did not conſiſt ſimply in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized at any time, but in conjunction with his Baptiſm it ſelf, in his being baptized at ſuch a time and upon ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as that was, when and wherein he began to profeſs and publiſh the Goſpel. For otherwiſe it is not to be thought, but that Chriſt had an opportunity of being baptized long before, and much ſooner then he was, in as much as <hi>Iohn</hi> had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed baptizing a conſiderable ſpace of time before Chriſt came to to be baptized of him. For <hi>Iohn</hi> had travelled much ground, even <hi>all the Country round about Iordan,</hi> both to preach and baptize, which muſt needs take up much time, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great multitudes that were baptized of him, even <hi>Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, Luk.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5. And as it ſhould ſeem, after this, or at leaſt after a large progreſs herein made, Jeſus Chriſt was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized alſo, as appears by the order of the Hiſtory of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: <hi>Now when all the people were baptized</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110914:33"/>it came to paſs that Jeſus alſo being baptized, and praying, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 3.21. Now what may we conceive might be the reaſon why Chriſt was not baptized rather with the firſt then with the laſt of the people? Certainly, it is not reaſonable to conceive, that it was becauſe he had leſs zeal to fulfil this Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then was in the multitude that were baptized before him; and if not this, what elſe imaginable but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that his
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ieſus ſaid unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is alway ready.</hi> Joh. 7.6.</note> appointed time and ſeaſon of his appearing with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the world, was not till then, and therefore not his time of being baptized, in as much as the one was in order to the other, and was to take its riſe and beginning from the other. And this we have further reaſon the rather to conceive, becauſe of that Particle <hi>NOW,</hi> emphatically here uſed, as it relates to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of righteouſneſs by that which was to be done: <hi>Suffer it to be ſo NOW</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Joh.</hi> touching his being baptized) <hi>For thus it becometh us to fulfil allrighteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 3.15. Not only in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized of him, but in being baptized of him NOW, to wit, at that juncture of time in which he was to be manifeſted to the world to be the Son of God, &amp; to manifeſt to the world the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God: NOW to be baptized, <hi>viz.</hi> upon ſuchterms, it was a thing very comely, (though <hi>John</hi> ſeemed to think otherwiſe) in as much as that it was a fulfilling of righteouſneſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> that righteous law or inſtitution of God, given in that behalf. And thus we ſee, that the example of Chriſt's Perſonal Baptiſm, which was intreated to bleſs the opinion for Infant Baptiſm, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it altogether.</p>

            <head>The Second Part, SHEWING, <hi>How neceſſary it is for perſons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized after they believe, their Infant-Baptiſm notwithſtanding: as alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the diſorderly and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Communion of perſons baptized with ſuch as are unbaptized in Church Fellowſhip.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving in the former part of this Diſcourſe, laid down part of thoſe grounds and reaſons which have ſwayed my judgment, and ſatisfied my conſcience in the ſight of God, touching the unlawfulneſs of Infant Baptiſm; and which I doubt not will have the like influence and operation upon the unbyaſſed minds of other men: It remains now that I come to ſpeak ſomething to theſe two queſtions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether men may not reſt ſatisfied with that Baptiſm, which was adminiſtred to them in their Infancy, without any further reception of Baptiſm afterwards, notwithſtanding they come to underſtand the irregularity of their Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be neceſſary for ſuch perſons who have for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110914:34"/>ſome conſiderable ſpace of time, made profeſſion of the faith, though as yet unbaptized; whether it be neceſſary for them to be baptized? ſince the ends of Baptiſm ſeem to be anticipated by ſuch a continued profeſſion.</p>
            <p>As touching the former of theſe Queſtions; I conceive I may affirm, that none may ſafely and without danger of ſin, reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that Baptiſm which they received in their Infancy, they coming once to underſtand the irregularity and ſinfulneſs of Infant Baptiſm: and I do aſſert it upon theſe grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (as may reaſonably be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) did not hold it convenient or ſafe, for certain Diſciples with whom he met, to reſt ſatisfied with ſuch a Baptiſm as had been formerly either erroneouſly adminiſtred to them, or elſe which was deficient as touching ſome ſpecial ends of that Baptiſm, which was enjoyned the Diſciples of Chriſt, but did proceed to baptize them, or to cauſe them to be baptized afreſh. The Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is touching thoſe certain Diſciples which <hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and of whom he demanded, <hi>Whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt ſince they had believed?</hi> Unto whom they reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That they had not ſo much as heard whether there were any Holy Ghoſt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul) were ye baptized? And they ſaid, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Johns Baptiſm. Then ſaid Paul, John verily baptized with the Baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould believe on him that was to come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 19.1.2.3.4.5.6.</p>
            <p>In this paſſage of Scripture, there are three things which I would have obſerved as to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is touching the Baptiſm, which theſe Diſciples are ſaid formerly to have received.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is touching their later Baptiſm, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtructing them.</p>
            <p>And the third is touching the reaſon why they were now baptized upon <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching to them, notwithſtanding they had formerly been baptized unto Johns Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe Diſciples had been formerly baptized unto Johns
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110914:35"/>Baptiſm, is that which they themſelves affirm, <hi>verſe</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the ſame Diſciples were now again baptized upon <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching Chriſt to them, I conceive fairly appears by thoſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>When they heard this, (viz.</hi> that which <hi>Paul</hi> had declared to them) <hi>they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are indeed two other Interpretations of theſe words urged by ſome, that do much differ from that ſence which I have now given; but are both beſide the Scope and meaning of the place, as I ſuppoſe I ſhall preſently make appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some by their being baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, as here in this place, would have us to underſtand it, not of their being baptized with water, but of their being baptized with the Spirit; which is Maſter <hi>Calvins</hi> ſence upon the place: and ſo he takes theſe words, <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and thoſe that follow in the next verſe, <hi>viz. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with tongues and propheſied,</hi> to import one and the ſame thing; and that the later words are only an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the former, ſhewing after what manner they were baptized: and he further ſaith, <hi>That for the viſible graces of the Spirit which were given by the laying on of hands;</hi> for this to be expreſſed by the name of Baptiſm, is no new thing, as he does alledg from <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. and 11.16.</p>
            <p>But, 1. That their being baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and their receiving the Holy Ghoſt upon the laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, were not the ſame thing as is alledged, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; 1. By a due conſideration both of the different nature of the actions themſelves, and the ſucceſſive order of thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent actions. For the doctrine, and ſo the practiſe of Baptiſm is one thing, and that of laying on of hands is another, as is apparent by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. where the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and of laying on of hands, are differenced by the ſame note of diſtinction, by which the Doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and eternal judgment, are differenced from them both. And the ſame thing appears from the order and ſueceſſion of theſe different actions, as well as from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature of them. For we have, 1. <hi>Pauls</hi> teaching of theſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110914:35"/>Diſciples diſtinctly mentioned. 2. The baptizing of them in Name of Chriſt as following thereupon, as diſtinctly deſcribed. And 3. The laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, and their receiving of the Holy Ghoſt thereupon, as diſtinctly and differentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as either of the former. The article <hi>AND,</hi> which ſtands between the Deſcription of their Baptiſm, and recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt upon the impoſit on of hands, being a Note here, not of identity or ſameneſs of things, but of tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or paſſing from one thing to another, or elſe of copulation of things really diſtinct, but yet relative. 2. This is further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by a collation of this paſſage of Scripture with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where we have the ſame actions, in the ſame order de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16, 17. where ſpeaking of the Holy Ghoſt, the holy <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſaith, That <hi>he was fallen upon none of them,</hi> to wit, the believing <hi>Samaritans, onely they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus: then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Whence it plainly appears, that the Diſciples were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, before they received the Holy Ghoſt: and that they did receive the Holy Ghoſt after their Baptiſm, upon thoſe prayers that were made for them, &amp; hands laid on them for that end: ſo that theſe were not one, but two diſtinct actions. Juſt ſo in the place under diſcuſſion: though they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, yet we do not find, that they received the Holy Ghoſt, till impoſition of hands was ſuper-added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is further alledged by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that it is no new thing to expreſs the gift of the viſible graces of the Spirit, by the name of Baptiſm; though this is indeed true, in ſuch a ſence as the Scriptures to which he refers intend it, yet I do believe it is a new thing, and not to be found in Scripture, to expreſs the effuſion of the Spirit, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from Baptiſm by water, under the deſcription of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, the form here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Text under debate. For both thoſe places produced, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. and 11.16. ſpeak of the Fathers, or Chriſts own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate act of conferring the Spirit; whereas to baptize in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, plainly and directly notes the Agency
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110914:36"/>or Miniſtry of man, managed in the Name of Chriſt: the one is the Baptiſm of Chriſt miniſtred by himſelf, the other is the Baptiſm of Chriſt miniſtred by man in his Name. And ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf at another turn will tell you, that, <hi>When John ſaid, I indeed baptize with water, but Chriſt when he ſhall come, ſhall baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, he meant not to put difference between the one Baptiſm, and the other, but he compares his own perſon with the Perſon of Chriſt, ſaying, that himſelf was a Miniſter of water, but that Chriſt was the Giver of the Holy Ghoſt. Inſtit. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.5.8. And the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and the pouring out of the Spirit, are not the ſame individual thing, but are clearly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced and diſtinguiſhed in reſpect of time, order, and action, as I noted in part before from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16 17. a place in this reſpect parallel with this in hand. So that ſtill you will find, that to baptize in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, ſignifies ſuch a Baptiſm as is not without water.</p>
            <p>But ſome others, not liking ſo well this conſtruction of the words, though they be of the ſame mind, as to the impugning of that literall ſence of them which I have imbraced, have thought of another way to evade this, and that is by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe words, <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as the words of <hi>Paul</hi> recited by <hi>Luke,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Baptiſm of theſe Diſciples by <hi>Iohn,</hi> to be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of <hi>Johns</hi> preaching to them, and not the words of <hi>Luke,</hi> as recording their Baptiſm as conſequential to <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching to them; and ſo the ſence they make to be this: That theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when they heard <hi>John</hi> in his preaching ſay to them, that they ſhould believe on him that was to come after him, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, then they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus by <hi>Iohn.</hi> See the late Annotators upon the place for this,</p>
            <p>But that neither this is the true intent, and genuine ſence of the words, I ſtrongly incl ne to believe upon theſe grounds. 1. Becauſe this Interpretation overthrowes the Grammatical ſence of the words, and renders them void of Common ſence. For it is evident, that what <hi>Paul</hi> is here brought in ſpeaking, he ſpake it to theſe Diſciples themſelves; for here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110914:36"/>of any other perſons but <hi>Paul,</hi> and them. Now then what ever words were ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> to them, muſt run in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, if you will ſuppoſe <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak common ſence; whereas theſe words, <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> are ſpoken in the third Perſon, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to them, but of <hi>Luke</hi> concerning them. For if <hi>Paul</hi> would have declared ſuch a thing to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as that they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus upon the hearing of <hi>Iohn,</hi> then his words ſhould have run thus: <hi>When you heard this, you were baptized, &amp;c.</hi> and not as now we have them, <hi>When they heard this, they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides, how uncouth and harſh is it, to make the people whom <hi>Iohn</hi> taught and baptized, and thoſe twelve Diſciples, to be the ſame perſons? and to conceive that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould tell them what <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid to the people, when all the while he meant themſelves; both which you muſt ſuppoſe, if you take the words in that ſence which I oppoſe; becauſe then the people in the fourth <hi>verſe,</hi> unto whom <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake, and thoſe in the fifth <hi>verſe,</hi> which are ſaid to have heard, and to have been baptized, muſt be the ſame perſons, and conſequently both of them theſe twelve men; becauſe as the Pronouns <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> in the fourth, and fifth <hi>verſe,</hi> upon that ſuppoſition, that both are <hi>Pauls</hi> words, cannot be underſtood, but of the ſame perſons, ſo alſo the ſame Pronouns <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> which relate both to the perſons baptized, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and to the twelve that propheſied after <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands on them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. are undoubtedly meant of the ſame perſons likewiſe: And therefore that interpretation now under examination, which runs us upon ſuch rocks of abſurdity, and into ſuch Soleciſms of ſpeaking as theſe, muſt be rejected; and conſequently theſe words, <hi>When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> muſt be taken as the words of <hi>Luke,</hi> and not of <hi>Paul,</hi> importing the Baptiſm of theſe Diſciples upon the hearing of <hi>Paul,</hi> and not of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe words, <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> are not a Deſcription of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm adminiſtred to theſe Diſciples, but of that Baptiſm which they received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, we have this reaſon further to conceive;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110914:37"/>becauſe it no where appears that <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize the people in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Nay, the truth is, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith concerning him that was to come after him, (which was Jeſus Chriſt) that he did not know him until the time that he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.30, 31. <hi>For he was before me, and I knew him not:</hi> and again, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>And I knew him not: but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> If <hi>Iohn</hi> then did not know Jeſus, either perſonally, or by his proper name, until this time, then we have no reaſon to conceive that he had baptiz d any hitherunto in this proper Name of his, and yet before this time he had diſpatched the greateſt part of his Miniſtry, in as much as he was but to prepare the way for Chriſt, who upon this Baptiſm of his, entred into his Miniſtry, he then coming on, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was going off. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37. and 1.22.</p>
            <p>But to put the buſineſs out of doubt; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> here in this fourth <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. does plainly declare, that <hi>Iohn</hi> when he baptized did <hi>ſay unto the people, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that ſhould come after him,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> indeed does here interpret to theſe Diſciples to be meant of Chriſt Jeſus. But if <hi>Iohn</hi> had baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus explicitly, why had not <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid ſo? rather then to ſay that <hi>He baptized them, ſaying unto them, that they ſhould believe on him that ſhould come after him?</hi> Or why ſhould we conclude, that if theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had been baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> into Chriſt Jeſus expreſly and by name, that <hi>Paul</hi> would have made ſuch a buſineſs of it to inform them of that of which they could not be ignorant, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were baptized into Chriſt Jeſus, If there fore we will take the true ſcope and meaning of this paſſage of Scripture, we muſt I conceive underſtand it thus. 1. That theſe Diſciples having been baptized unto <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptiſm, were baptized into one as yet to come, and to be made manifeſt unto the world, according to <hi>Iohn's</hi> accuſtomed manner on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> did now open and declare to them, who that was that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid was to come after him, and that he did declare him to them now, not as one to come, but as one alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come; for ſo that ſhort expoſitory ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> here,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110914:37"/>
               <hi>THAT IS ON CHRIST IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> doth import, as containing the ſubject matter of <hi>Paul's</hi> diſcourſe then. And then 3. That theſe Diſciples hearing, underſtanding and believing this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he who is called Jeſus Chriſt, was he that was now come, and had ſuffered death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And was he whom the Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> did then point at more obſcurely as one that was to come, though not then perſonally and by name known amongſt the people; I ſay upon their hearing and believing this, <hi>they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> as acknowledging him to be that Meſſiah, into the expectation of whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been baptized.</p>
            <p>And ſo we come to the third thing which we were to enquire into out of this Contexture of Scripture, and that is, why or for what reaſon it may be conceived, that theſe Diſciples were now bapt zed again upon the hearing of <hi>Paul,</hi> when as they had been baptized unto the Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> formerly. And the reaſon hereof muſt be, either 1. Becauſe, that though theſe Diſciples had been baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> unto the Meſſias that was then to come after him, yet this was not ſufficient when once they came to the acknowledgment of Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> to be that Meſſias, but that notwithſtanding this, they were then to be baptized into Chriſt Jeſus as acknowledging him to be that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah indeed, which before they did expect: Or elſe 2. Becauſe there was ſome error committed, in the adminiſtration and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Baptiſm: and other reaſons then theſe, I think will not lightly preſent themſelves to any mans mind.</p>
            <p>For the former of theſe; ſome indeed have conceived that ſuch who were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> unto him that was to come, not yet knowing him perſonally, were afterwards baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when they came to acknowledge Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the world: and truly this opinion is not altogether to be deſpiſed, in as much as there is an appearance of reaſon, both that it was ſo, and why it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was ſo, there is this reaſon to induce the belief thereof; becauſe though as it ſhould ſeem, all the <hi>Jews</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> yet very conſiderable numbers of them were baptized afterwards when they came to own Jeſus for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110914:38"/>the Meſſiah. That the <hi>Jews</hi> generally were baptized by <hi>John</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that it is ſaid, <hi>There went out to him Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Iorden, and were baptized of him in Iorden confeſſing their ſins, Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. That there were very conſiderable numbers of the Inhabitants of theſe places baptized afterwards when they came to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Jeſus to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the world, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. where we ſhall find, that at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it ſelf, there were upon the hearing of <hi>Peter,</hi> and their gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the word, no leſs then about three thouſand baptized in one day. Now let it be conſidered, how improbable it is; that ſince the Inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and all <hi>Iudea</hi> were baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that theſe three thouſand at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> only, and that in one day, ſhould be converted and bap ized, and yet not any one of them be of that number which <hi>Iohn</hi> had baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Beſides, whereas it is ſaid, that they that gladly received his word were baipized, it muſt be ſuppoſed, either 1. That not one of all the <hi>Iews</hi> which were baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> formerly, did now gladly receive the word; Or elſe 2. That ſome of them which had been baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> were now again bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon <hi>Peters</hi> preaching. For when it is ſaid, They that glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received his word were baptized, we have reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of all that did ſo receive it, for here is no exception made of ſuch as had been baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> as indeed there is not in any other place. If then it be no wayes probable, that in ſo great and eminent a coming in of the <hi>Iews</hi> to the Goſpel, as this was, but that ſome of thoſe who had been formerly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the expectation of Chriſt, did now gladly receive the word of the Goſpel, by which even Jeſus ſtood declared to be both Lord and Chriſt, then it cannot but be ſo probable, that even ſome of them whom <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized were afterwards bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again, that there is ſcarce place left for any contrary thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there is this reaſon to prove that it was ſo, ſo there is reaſon alſo to prove why it ſhould be ſo: For their being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>Iohn</hi> unto him that was to come as the Meſſiah, when as yet not known by them, did not prove, as the event declares, either any effectual means by which to own and acknowledge
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110914:38"/>him for ſuch when he was come, nor to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch who did reject him, which yet are two principal ends of Baptiſm. For whereas all the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and thoſe parts, did generally receive <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm, as being under great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of an immediate appearing of the Meſſiah, and which they notioned to themſelves as one that ſhould come in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate and glory; yet when he was come, und they found him who was preſented to them for the Meſſiah, to be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but him whom they called the Carpenters Son, one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſo mean a Garb, and deſpecable a condition as he did, contrary to their pre-received notion of him, and expectation concerning him, then they generally were offended at him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and rejected him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.55, 56, 57. <hi>Iſay</hi> 53.2, 3. That very few did own Chriſt Jeſus when he came to be made manifeſt unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of thoſe very many that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> appears by that ſaying concerning Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.32. <hi>What he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth his teſtimony:</hi> meaning that very few did. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. Chriſt ſpeaking to the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that they were <hi>willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light, ver.</hi> 35. but ſpeaking to the ſame perſons concerning himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. ſaith, <hi>For whom he</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> God) <hi>hath ſent, him ye believe not.</hi> See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.37, 38. Though all the <hi>Iews</hi> generally did look for a Chriſt, yet but few of them did acknowledg Jeſus to be the Chriſt. If then the generality of thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> unto Chriſt then to come, did reject him when he was come, then certainly the Baptiſm which was received from <hi>Iohn,</hi> could be no diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mark, or characteriſtical badge of the Diſciples of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or that by which their publick and profeſſed owning of him could be reckoned: and therefore by how much it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus ſhould be diſtinguiſhed and known from thoſe that believed not in him, and ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs and own Jeſus to be the Chriſt in and by Baptiſm, (which yet will be found to be none of the leaſt ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm) by ſo much it ſeems neceſſary, that thoſe that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſhould afterwards be baptized again when they came to own Ieſus for the Chriſt of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others there are which conceive, that the reaſon why
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110914:39"/>theſe twelve Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus</hi> were baptized again upon their hearing the Goſpel from <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding they had been formerly baptized unto <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm, was, becauſe of ſome errour committed in their Baptiſm. As 1. That they were baptized into the expectation of Chriſt to come, after the time in which he was actually come. And 2. That they had not been baptized in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, as they ought to have been according to the Commiſſion of Chriſt on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. when as they were (as is ſuppoſed) bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized after this Commiſſion was on foot.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they were baptized unto him that was to come as they underſtood, appears in that they were baptized unto <hi>Iohns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the tenour whereof was an inviting them to believe on him that was to come as <hi>Paul</hi> here aſſerts, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they were not baptized in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, is gathered from their own words, by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they <hi>had not ſo much as heard, whether there were any Holy Ghoſt, ver.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they were baptized after ſuch time in which Chriſt was actually come, had ſuffered, was riſen again, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that Commiſſion of baptizing in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the Father and Son, is gathered by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral things together. As 1. That they were Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and therefore probably as <hi>Iohn</hi> was never there to baptize them, ſo neither were they ever where <hi>Iohn</hi> was, to be baptized of him. But that 2. In probability they were baptized unto <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm by <hi>Apollos</hi> while he was at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> which was long after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and his Commiſſion to baptize in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt: The probability of their being baptized by <hi>Apollos</hi> is made out by theſe things conſidered coniunctively. 1. That <hi>Apollos</hi> was a man who greatly endeavoured the making of Diſciples to that way which he himſelf profeſſed, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 18.25, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. 2. That while he was at <hi>Epheſus, he being fervent in Spirit, eloquent, and mighty in the Scriptures, taught dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the way of the Lord, only ſo far as was agreeable to the Baptiſm of Iohn,</hi> until after <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> had privately better inſtructed him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.25, 26. And therefore 3. It
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110914:39"/>is conceived by ſome (as I ſay) that he did convert theſe twelve Diſciples unto, that way which he himſelf ſo diligently taught, to wit, the Doctrine and Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that he did thereupon baptize them according to <hi>Iohns</hi> manner and form of baptizing.</p>
            <p>Now whether you take this to be the reaſon of their re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, or whether the former, it will amount much to the ſame as concerning that which I would gather from this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>For 1. If thoſe which were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf, were afterwards baptized again when they came to own Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and that becauſe their former Baptiſm was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in reſpect of ſome important ends of Baptiſm, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in reſpect of aſſerting Jeſus to be the Chriſt, a principal end of Baptiſm, then thoſe that come actually to believe, ought to be then baptized, notwithſtanding any Baptiſm they received in their infancy, becauſe ſuch their Infant Baptiſm, was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſufficient as unto ſeveral weighty ends of Baptiſm, as hath been abundantly declared in the former part of this our diſcourſe. For where there are the ſame reaſons of things as here, there ought the ſame things to be done and practiſed; I mean in things of this nature.</p>
            <p>Or 2. If an erronious adminiſtration and reception of theſe twelve Diſciples Baptiſm, was the reaſon of their Re-baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other opinion holds, then there is like reaſon likewiſe why thoſe who have been baptized in their infancy, ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, be baptized when they come to repent and believe, becauſe that infant-adminiſtration, though not in the ſelf ſame reſpects, was deeply erronious as well as theirs, as hath been formerly proved.</p>
            <p>But in as much as my judgment doth much rather incline to the former opinion then this later, as touching the reaſon why theſe Diſciples were re-baptized; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here give this further account thereof. And ſo far as I can perceive, upon a ſerious conſideration of things, a re-baptizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was neceſſary in thoſe that had been baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> (Chriſt only excepted as a caſe extraordinary) in order to their reception of the Holy Spirit. For we ſhall find, that not the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110914:40"/>baptizing of men into the expectation of Chriſt to come, had the promiſe of the Spirit, but the baptizing of them into the faith and acknowledgment of Chriſt come, and of Ieſus to be that Chriſt, and ſo conſequently that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm had no ſuch promiſe annext to it as Chriſt's Baptiſm had on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm had no ſuch promiſe of the Spirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his own acknowledgment and aſſertion, in which he makes this very difference between his own Baptiſm, and the Baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that his was but a Baptiſm <hi>of water unto repentance, but that he which ſhould come after him, ſhould baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, Matth.</hi> 3.11. Nay, <hi>Mark</hi> hath it thus, which is ſomewhat fuller: <hi>I indeed have baptized you with water, but he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, Mark</hi> 1.8. His manner of ſpeaking ſeems to import, as if he intended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to beat them off from any expectation of the Spirit, upon the account of his Baptiſm now they had received it; and to put them upon the expectation thereof, from and by the Baptiſm of Chriſt when he ſhould come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (accompanied with the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles herein) addreſſing himſelf to that great multitude that heard him preach at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> adviſes them in order to their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Holy Ghoſt, to repent and to be baptized, and that every one of them in the Name of the Lord Ieſus, Acts</hi> 2.38.</p>
            <p>Conſider now who theſe were to whom he gives this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And we ſhall find, that it was <hi>the multitude,</hi> as they are called, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>that came together,</hi> flocking doubtleſs from all parts of the City upon occaſion of that miraculous wonder of fiery cloven tongues, ſiting upon the Apoſtles, and of their ſpeaking with ſtrange tongues, <hi>when this was noiſed abroad,</hi> as there it is ſaid. And can any man imagine, that when as but about four years before this, the Inhabitants of this City gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally went out to be baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and now as generally came together to hear and ſee this wonder, that yet none of them that now came together, ſhould be of that number that had been baptized by <hi>Iohn?</hi> Surely ſuch a thing will not be any mans thought, or if it ſhall, yet will not be believed amongſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men. And yet even theſe, notwithſtanding their having
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110914:40"/>been baptized by <hi>John,</hi> are directed and exhorted now afreſh, to repent and be baptized, and that <hi>EVERY ONE of them in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſſured, <hi>that they ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Their being baptized then in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, was neceſſary to render them meet to receive the Holy Ghoſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their former Baptiſm by <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If things be well weighed, I conceive it will be found, that theſe twelve Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus</hi> were baptized again, though they had been baptized formerly unto <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, upon this very account eſpecially, and in order to this very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> their receiving the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>For 1. The manner, form, and import of <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtions, or demands to them, and their anſwers to him, do imply, that as it was common for the Spirit to be given upon the reception of Chriſts Baptiſm, ſo alſo that it was not wont to be given upon the adminiſtration of <hi>Johns.</hi> For when <hi>Paul</hi> queries, <hi>Whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt ſince they had believed, ver.</hi> 2. And ſo when he again demands upon their declaring they had not, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then they had been baptized?</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies, that <hi>Paul</hi> did verily expect that they ſhould have received the Holy Ghoſt upon their being baptized, until he was informed that they had been baptized only unto <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm. And not onely ſo, but that queſtion of his, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then were ye baptized, ſince ye have not received the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> does alſo imply, that <hi>Paul</hi> very well knew, that there was a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which was not accompanied with the giving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and therefore the end of his queſtion was to know, Unto which Baptiſm they had been baptized: and upon their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Caſe, ſhewing that they had been baptized only unto <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, the true reaſon was diſcovered why they had not received the Holy Choſt; as being that which did not uſe to follow upon <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm; the which appears hereby, in that they knew <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, and the manner of it, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being baptized thereunto; and yet they had not ſo much as heard that there was a Holy Ghoſt, to wit, extant in the world upon any ſuch terms, as <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion unto them did import; of which ſurely they could not have been ignorant, if
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110914:41"/>the Holy Ghoſt had been wont to be vouchſafed unto men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Baptiſm ſave that of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That their re-baptizing, or their being baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus mentioned in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of <hi>Acts</hi> 19, was in direct order to their receiving the Holy Ghoſt, the thing firſt in queſtion between <hi>Paul</hi> and them, may eaſily be gathered from the connexion that is b tween the 5. and 6. <hi>verſes,</hi> and the matters therein related. For that their being baptized as ſet forth, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and their receiving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. were neerly related, the later having a dependance on the former, the Conjunction copulative <hi>AND,</hi> which knits both matters together, ſhews. For ſo the words run: <hi>When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus. AND when, i.e.</hi> when this was done, <hi>AND when Paul had laid his hands on them:</hi> which imports as much I conceive as if he had ſaid, <hi>AND when alſo Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them; i.e.</hi> then or thereupon the Holy Ghoſt came on them. So that their receiving of the Holy Ghoſt relates, both to their being baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and to the impoſition of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands: both which in their due order did prepare and diſpoſe them for that reception.</p>
            <p>To conclude this therefore: if then, men were to be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, when they came to believe in him; in order to their receiving the Spirit of God, though they had been before baptized by <hi>Iohn;</hi> then ſurely have they need to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the ſame end, who come to the acknowledgment of the truth, though they have been baptized (as men call bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing) in their infancy, becauſe ſuch their Infant-Baptiſm as hath been formerly evinced, doth not operate towards their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Holy Ghoſt, as true Goſpel Baptiſm will do.</p>
            <p>Come we now more briefly unto a ſecond reaſon why it is not ſafe for any to ſatisfie themſelves with that Baptiſm which they received in their Infancy, the irregularity of it ſuppoſed, and that is, becauſe it is none of Gods Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is none of his ordaining, but is <hi>the device of mans own heart.</hi> As it is ſaid of that Feaſt which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ordained, though in other reſpects, <hi>it was like unto the Feaſt that was in Iuda,</hi> to wit, of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110914:41"/>Gods own appointing, yet becauſe he took liberty to vary the time of its celebration, from the fourteenth day of the firſt month, the time of Gods own chuſing, unto the fifteenth day of the eighth Month, which is therefore called <hi>the month which he had deviſed of his own heart,</hi> therefore was this Feaſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed none of Gods Feaſt, but <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Feaſt, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.32, 33. And is there not the ſame proportion of reaſon to adjudg Infant-Baptiſm, to have none other Authour but man, and to be a thing <hi>deviſed of mans own heart?</hi> Though it ſhould be granted, that in reſpect of the outward Element and actions thereto belonging, it were like unto the Baptiſm which is from God; yet in as much as man take liberty to vary the ſeaſon of its adminiſtration, from the time of mens regeneration, or new birth, the time of Gods own appointment, unto the time of their natural Birth, which is none of Gods; it therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily deſerves to be called the <hi>device of mans own heart.</hi> And if it be none of Gods Baptiſm, then certainly its no-wiſe ſafe to adhere thereto, in as much as Chriſt hath declared, <hi>That every plant which his Heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up,</hi> and that every ſuch <hi>worſhip is vain which is ordered and taught by the precepts of men, Matth.</hi> 15.9 13. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe if Infant-Baptiſm be ſinful; ſinful in parents to deſire it for their children; and ſinful in thoſe that adminiſter it to them (as it hath been proved to be) then may none when they come to maturity, reſt ſatisfied in that Baptiſm, or in the leaſt own it without danger of partaking with them in their ſin, becauſe that which <hi>de facto</hi> is ſinfully done by another, becomes my ſin when I come to own and approve it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.48.49, 50.51. which yet is the caſe of thoſe which ſatisfie themſelves with that Baptiſm they have received in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Its not ſafe for any to reſt contented with that Baptiſm which they received when they were Infants, becauſe that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which is ſo called, is a meer Nuility in reſpect of that thing for which it is taken, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is not worthy to be eſteemed any ſuch thing as is Baptiſm indeed, or to paſs under that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe there is that wanting in it, which is eſſential to true Baptiſm. For, 1. There is the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110914:42"/>right ſubject of Baptiſm, wanting in that Baptiſm, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Infants; that Infants are not the ſubject of Baptiſm, is that the proof and demonſtration whereof hath taken up the former part of this Treatiſe, and therefore ſhall take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. 2. As the right Subject matter, ſo the true external form of baptiſmal adminiſtration is wanting in Infant-Baptiſm, as it is practiſed among us. For the external form of Baptiſm, is not a <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of the party baptized with water, which yet is that which is uſed in the Baptiſm of infants, but a <hi>dipping</hi> or plunging him under water.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This appears at leaſt in the judgment of very many who ſo render that which we have tranſlated baptizing or to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; in ſo much as Maſter <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> in his Treatiſe on the two Sacraments, ſaith, that dipping is that <hi>which Antiquity conſtantly and without exception of Countries, hot or cold, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth unto.</hi> And as it is to the ſame import frequently tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Bible, ſo it is acknowledged, indeed aſſerted to be the manner of baptizing in the primitive time, to dip or bury the body under water, by <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf on <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. and by our late Annotators on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. Beſides Maſter <hi>Mead</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. in his Diatribe, and Maſter <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> in his Treatiſe of Chriſt ſet forth in his death, &amp;c. with very many others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It further appears by that which Baptiſm repreſents, and that is the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the party baptized his death, burial, and reſurrection with Chriſt. For the water in which men are baptized or dipped, is no more an Element for them to live in, then the earth is: Nay we know the Sea is frequently made the place of burial for the dead as well as the earth: and therefore a being put under the water, is upon the matter as lively a reſemblance of ones death and burial, as it would be if one were ſo long put under the earth, and ſo conſequently a mans coming or riſing from under the water, is upon the matter as clear and lively a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a reſurrection from the dead, as if he did come out of the grave, and from under the earth upon like terms. Now then, thoſe that are dipt in their baptiſm, do if they anſwer the nature of that Ordinance, thereby actually profeſs,</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:110914:42"/>
            <p n="1">1. That they do believe that Chriſt Jeſus, into whoſe Name they are baptized, was as truly and really dead, buried, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again in order to the ſalvation of men, as they are then fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively dead, buried, and raiſed again in their Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they do thereby engage themſelves to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, in their being thence forth dead to thoſe ſins in which they formerly lived, and from which their lives were then denominated; as likewiſe as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their living a new &amp; ſpiritual life unto God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. For as Chriſt when he was crucified, then ceaſed to live any longer ſuch a life in the fleſh as thither-unto he had done; and when he roſe again, begun that new and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life which before he had not lived; even ſo all thoſe that anſwer their engagement and profeſſion entred into by baptiſm, do from the time of this figurative death and burial of theirs, really ceaſe to live their former ſinful life; and from the time of their figurative reſurrection, or new-birth, begin to live a new life of obedience and ſubjection unto Chriſt their Lord: Theſe things lie fair in thoſe Scriptures, wherein ſuch are ſaid <hi>to be baptized into Chriſts death, to be buried with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, wherein alſo they are ſaid to be riſen with him, and to be planted together into the likeneſs of his death, and the likeneſs of his reſurrection, that thenceforth they ſhould not ſerve ſin, but walk in newneſs of life, Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. Theſe things then being ſo, the ſprinkling of the party baptized, or the pouring of a handful of water upon his face, is no more a figurative buriall of him, or a true repreſentation of Chriſts death and burial, then the caſting of a handful of duſt upon the face of Chriſt when he was dead could have been a burying of him. And therefore who ſees not hereby, that aſperſion or ſprinkling uſed in infant-baptiſm, is far from the true external form of Goſpel-baptiſm, and that which was anciently uſed by the Apoſtles and other ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt in the firſt and pureſt times of that adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>If then the right ſubject matter to be baptized, and the due external form of Baptiſm, be both wanting in that Baptiſm, which is and hath been adminiſtred to infants, then certainly ſuch a Baptiſm hath that wanting in it, which is eſſential to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110914:43"/>true being of Baptiſm. For what is more intrinſecally eſſential to the being of a thing, then matter and form? Or how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to define Baptiſm, or any thing elſe, without the matter and form which do intrinſecally conſtitute the very eſſence and being thereof? And certainly that which is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the true definition of Baptiſm as of all other things, is abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſary to the being of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where either the true matter, or the right form of a thing is wanting, much more where both are wanting, (which is the caſe in Infant-Baptiſm) there doubtleſs is a total deficiency, or non-entity of the thing it ſelf; which clearly is the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm in reference to the queſtion in hand. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that thinks to build any ſuch thing upon that Baptiſm he hath received in his Infancy, which is competent or proper to true Baptiſm indeed, hath but air and vanity for his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>THe ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, Whether baptiſm by water ought neceſſarily to be received by ſuch perſons, who have for ſome conſiderable ſpace of time, made profeſſion of the faith, though it be granted that they were never duly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before; ſince ſuch a long continued courſe of profeſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding baptiſm, renders ſuch an Adminiſtration of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unparallel and without example in Scripture, and ſince alſo the ends of Baptiſm hereby ſeem to be anticipated or prevented?</p>
            <p>Which queſtion I muſt needs reſolve in the affirmative, and do ſay, That notwithſtanding all that is pretended to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is a thing neceſſary, and a duty incumbent on every ſuch man and woman as hath not been baptized before, with a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm duly ſo called, to ſubmit to, and take up the Ordinance of water-baptiſm, though it be not till long after the time in which they firſt began a conſcientious profeſſion of the Goſpel other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Here I take for granted, upon account of what I have before delivered, that Infant-baptiſm, and no baptiſm, are of the ſame conſideration, this difference only excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infant-baptiſm is a ſin of Commiſſion in thoſe that occaſion it;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110914:43"/>and Non-baptiſm is a ſin of Omiſſion in thoſe that neglect it, when otherwiſe they are duly qualified for it.</p>
            <p>In the managing of this reſolution of the queſtion, I ſhall endeavour 1, To lay down ſome reaſons and grounds thereof. And 2. To anſwer thoſe exceptions and objections which take place in the minds of ſome againſt the practiſe of Baptiſm upon ſuch terms.</p>
            <p>The grounds on which I do aſſert Baptiſm neceſſary, though but on the terms before ſpecified, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a duty enjoyned every one that imbraceth the Doctrine of Chriſt or of the Goſpel, to be baptized one time or other. This appears by that Commiſſion which was given by Chriſt to his Servants and Meſſengers, to teach all Nations (or every creature, as <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.) and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. In which Commiſſion there are theſe two things enjoyned amongſt others. 1. That they ſhould teach all Nations, or every creature capable of this teaching, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſhould inſtruct them in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, or make them Diſciples, as the word is rendred. Now if we would know what they were to teach, and in what to inſtruct them; we may take information here about, from the practiſe of the Apoſtles, when firſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they began to put this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in execution; the brief Sum whereof was to this effect. <hi>That Jeſus of Nazareth, approved of God, by miracles, wonders, and ſignes, being delivered by the determinate counſel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God, was by wicked hands crucified and ſlain; and that God raiſed him up from the dead the third day, and hath made him the ſame Jeſus, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> They alſo further taught the people, that in order to their being ſaved by him, they ſhould <hi>repent and be baptized in his Name for the remiſſion of ſins, Acts</hi> 2.32.28. 2. The other part of Chriſts Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was, that having thus taught the people, and made them willing to imbrace the Goſpel, they ſhould then alſo baptize them; in purſuance of which Commiſſion, the Apoſtles did accordingly, in the place and time, and to the people before ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. For ſaith the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>They that gladly,</hi> (or willingly) <hi>received his word, were baptized.</hi> According to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110914:44"/>which beginning, we ſhall find, that they conſtantly proceeded afterwards, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12.35.37. and 10.36.48. and 16, 14, 14.31.33. and 18.8.</p>
            <p>Now then, if it were the duty of theſe Servants of Chriſt, to teach all Nations to repent, believe in Chriſt Jeſus, and to be baptized in his Name for the remiſſion of ſins; then certainly it was the duty of all theſe Nations, being thus taught, to obey this voice of the Goſpel, as well in being baptized, as in repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing. And by the way, leſt any ſhould think the Date of this Commiſſion laſted but during the Apoſtles dayes; the Lord Jeſus in annexing the promiſe of his preſence and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to thoſe that ſhould put this Commiſſion of his in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cauſeth the Date hereof to run along to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. which plainly ſhews, that he would have this Commiſſion of his obſerved and kept on foot, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Ground is this, Becauſe Baptiſm being one of the Doctrines of Chriſt which is practicable, ought therefore to be imbraced and practiſed, by all that profeſs themſelves Diſciples of Chriſt, and followers of his Doctrine. That Baptiſm is one of the Doctrines of Chriſt, appears by <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. Thoſe things which in general are called <hi>the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, ver.</hi> 1. being afterwards particularized, <hi>the Doctrine of Baptiſms,</hi> is ſet down for one of thoſe <hi>Principles.</hi> It's a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, both becauſe it is a Doctrine concerning Chriſt, in and by which Chriſt is ſet forth, profeſſed, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acknowledged; as alſo becauſe it is a Doctrine which Chriſt hath enjoyned to be taught and practiſed. And whereas the word is uſed in the plural number, <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſms;</hi> it doth not weaken, but ſtrengthen the authority of Water-baptiſm, as being comprehenſive of that, and any other Baptiſm taught by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now that the Doctrine of Chriſt ought to be obeyed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by all that profeſs themſelves his Diſciples, will not be gain-ſay'd, in as much as at what time they give up themſelves to him, and in particular make a ſolemn Dedication of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him and his ſervice by Baptiſm; they are ſaid to be <hi>delivered into the form of his Doctrine,</hi> (as the Marginal read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110914:44"/>imports) <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. And the Apoſtle cautions the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Romans, to note and avoid ſuch as cauſe diviſions and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 16.17. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Who ſo tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. Though I will not ſay, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tranſgreſſion of the Doctrine of Chriſt, riſeth ſo high in the evil effect and conſequence of it, as the evils mentioned in theſe Scriptures amount unto; nor in particular that tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which we now ſpeak, unleſs after conviction pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſiſted in; yet the leaſt that we can ſay, even of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer tranſgreſſions in this kind, is, that they have atendency in them hereunto, proportionable to the nature and delinquency of them.</p>
            <p>Baptiſm then being as we ſee, one of the Doctrines of Chriſt, and one of his Commiſſional Injunctions: what peace can any man have, whoſe heart ſtands in aw of the Word, (as <hi>Davids</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.116.) that ſhall live in the tranſgreſſion hereof, and diſobedience hereunto?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Baptiſm is therefore neceſſary, becauſe it is relative to the ſalvation of men. Thoſe in Acts 2.37. being ſmitten with the ſenſe of their ſin and miſery, upon the preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>crying out, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> viz. <hi>to be ſaved,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. it cannot reaſonably be thought, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, being now full of the Holy Ghoſt, by the newly received power whereof he then ſpake, would direct them to the belief or practiſe of any thing, but that which ſhould be very requiſit to their Salvation, the thing about which they with ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs enquire; and yet we ſee, the very firſt thing he directs them to, in anſwer to their demand, is, <hi>to repent and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of them in the Name of the Lord Jeſus for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, ver.</hi> 38. By which we gather, that Baptiſm as well as repentance, is one of the requiſites to remiſsion of ſins, and ſo unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It is the ſaying of Chriſt the faithful and true Witneſs, that <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, John</hi> 3.5. By a mans being born of water, Interpreters underſtand his being baptized of water, as by his being born of the Spirit, his regeneration. See the late
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110914:45"/>Annotations upon the place. Thoſe that are pleaſed to ſay, that too great a Streſs is laid upon Baptiſm by the Abetters of it, and thereupon blame them for urging and preſſing it, as a thing ſo neceſſary as ſometimes they do, may be turned over unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for an anſwer to their exception; for indeed they do not ſo much blame the Servants, as the Maſter himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of whoſe Doctrine, they ſo preſs this practiſe. So that each of them in this caſe may truly ſay to their Lord and Saviour, <hi>The rebukes of them, that rebuked me, are fallen upon thee.</hi> For none I preſume ever laid a greater Streſs upon Baptiſm, then Chriſt here does, in ſaying, <hi>Except a man be born of water,</hi> (i. e. be baptized) <hi>and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of the Oracles of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſame effect is, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Where we ſee our Saviour joyns baptiſm with faith, as requiſite to ſalvation: and what Chriſt in this hath joyned together, who is he that dares put aſunder? If any ſhall think, that Baptiſm is left out in the oppoſite member here (he not ſaying, he that believeth not, and is not baptized, ſhall be damned, but only he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned,) on purpoſe to indulge perſons in the hope of ſalvation who do believe, though they be not baptized; let ſuch rather judge with themſelves, that baptiſm being ſo expreſly joyned with faith in the former part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> as that upon which the promiſe of ſalvation is made by Chriſt, to depend as it is, it was leſs neceſſary to mention the want, or neglect thereof, with unbelief on the contrary, as that unto which damnation is threatned, becauſe frequently in Scripture dialect, where things are ſuccinctly delivered, the Affirmative ſuppoſes the Negative. And where Chriſt makes the aſſurance of ſalvation to depend upon faith and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm joyntly, as here, certainly it will be no mans wiſdom, but extream folly, to venture his ſalvation upon the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, upon the account of the afore-ſuggeſted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe, ſpeaking of that ſalvation which was vouchſafed thoſe in <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark, ſaith, <hi>The like figure
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110914:45"/>whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now, ſave us, not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. The Negative here, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, but interpretative, <hi>i.e.</hi> when he ſayes, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> h s meaning is not, that the outward waſhing or baptiſm doth not at all contribute towards ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the effect here mentioned, for that were to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water-baptiſm wholly needleſs, an interpretation which would fall foul on other Scriptures, which ſpeak the contrary: But his ſaying, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> is to be underſtood, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid; Not by that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or not ſo much by that; but by the inward waſhing alſo, and by the anſwer of a good conſcience in Conjunction with the outward act. It is a like form of ſpeech with that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi> meaning, that he was not ſent ſo much to baptize, as to preach the Goſpel: for otherwiſe, he was ſent to bapt ze, as well as preach, and accordingly he did baptize, as there he himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.16. And therefore that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning the man and the woman in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, is true concerning the outward and inward baptiſm, in this; <hi>Neither is the man without the woman, neither the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without the man in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11. So neither is the outward waſhing without the inward, nor the inward without the outward in the Lord, that is, by his appointment, and in order to the Salvation of men. If baptiſm then be <hi>a like figure,</hi> or that which holds an Analogical Proportion with the Ark in point of ſalvation, we may then eaſily gueſs, how neceſſ ry baptiſm is to ſalvation. For if we follow the Apoſtles figure, it w ll teach us, That as it was neceſſary for thoſe that would eſcape drowning in that Deluge of waters, to enter into the Ark, which was Gods appointed inſtrument of that ſalvation; ſo is it neceſſary for thoſe that would eſcape the perdition of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and unbelieving world, to be baptized, as being a means ordained by God for ſuch an end likewiſe.</p>
            <p>If then once to be baptized be a duty enjoyned every Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt, or ſuch as profeſs belief in his Name, as in the firſt particular; and a Doctrine of Chriſt to be imbraced
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110914:46"/>and followed, as in the ſecond, and a thing which ſo much concerns their ſalvation, as in the third particular hath been ſet forth; then how comes any mans long neglect of his duty, and of this Doctrine of Chriſt, and of this means of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, totally to exempt him therefrom? Does a mans doing his duty in other things priviledge him in the neglect of this? Or hath any mans long continuance in the profeſsion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, made that which was his duty long ſince to have done, ceaſe to be his duty now at all? when as he hath neither alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſcharged it, nor wants opportunity yet to do it: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, all ſuch imaginations are but vain thoughts.</p>
            <p>Upon occaſion of that which hath been ſaid, whereby the ſalvation of men ſeems much concerned in the due uſe of Baptiſm, it is like a queſtion will ariſe in the minds of ſome, whether I make Baptiſm a condition of ſalvation, or a thing neceſſary thereunto? Since ſo to do is looked upon, as a moſt importune notion and conceit, in as much as it is thought a moſt uncharitable cenſuring of many thouſands godly perſons that have died, and yet were not baptized, with other then their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm; as likewiſe of many thouſands now living, who cannot be perſwaded that it is their duty.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I deſire to make Baptiſm nothing elſe then what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes it, nor to put more neceſſity upon it, then what the Scripture hath put upon it, an account whereof I have in part gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore ſhall refer thoſe that deſire ſatisfaction in this particular, to the word of God, to conſider what that makes it, how far neceſſary, and how far not. Only in reviewing thoſe Scriptures which have been produced hereabout, I ſhall deſire that it may ſeriouſly be conſidered by thoſe that think Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſuperfluous where the Goſpel is commonly profeſſed, or at leaſt amongſt ſuch perſons that have long engaged in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious profeſſion thereof, as likewiſe by thoſe that make light of it, looking upon it, either as a thing indifferent, or elſe that which is but little more; I ſay, I would have it conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch, whether it would be handſom, or any whit like conſciencious Interpretors, or ſuch that fear to <hi>diminiſh</hi> ought from the word of God, to put ſuch like conſtructions upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110914:46"/>the Scriptures, which ſuch an opinion concerning Baptiſm in reference to ſuch profeſſors does ſuppoſe, and which I ſhall here point at. <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; i.e.</hi> (according to their opinion) a man may enter into the Kingdom of God, that is born of the Spirit, though he be not born of water. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, Mark</hi> 16 16. that is (the foreſaid opinion being Judg) he that believeth ſhall be ſaved whether he be baptized or no. So again, when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for remiſſion of ſins, Acts</hi> 2.38. that is, (if the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aforeſaid do not erre,) repent, and ye ſhall have the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, whether ever you be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, or no. For either this mangling of the ſacred word of Jeſus Chriſt, muſt paſs for a currant interpretation of theſe Scriptures, or elſe Baptiſm muſt be neceſſary in relation to the ſalvation of thoſe that will expect ſalvation in Gods way, and upon his terms, whether they be ſuch as have long ſince entred upon the Chriſtian profeſſion, or whether ſuch who are yet to begin it. This muſt be ſo, unleſs we will ſuppoſe, that God had one method and way of ſaving men in thoſe times in which theſe Scriptures were firſt given out and delivered to the world, and another way now; which if any man hath a mind to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let it be at his own peril; for my part, I look for ſalvation in the ancient Goſpel way, and upon no other terms. For if <hi>not one jot or tittle of the Law ſhall fail, till Heaven and Earth paſs away</hi> (which I am ſure is not yet) <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. much leſs ſhall any of the Goſpel. <hi>For if the word ſpoken by Angels</hi> (as the Law was) <hi>was ſtedfaſt, &amp;c. How ſhall we eſcape, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord himſelf, and afterwards was confirmed by thoſe that heard him?</hi> Heb. 2.2, 3. <hi>The word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.25. Therefore, <hi>adde not thou to his word, leſt he reprove thee and thou be found a lyar,</hi> Pro. 30.6. <hi>nor take away therefrom, leſt God take away thy part out of the Book of life,</hi> Rev. 22.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for thoſe, otherwiſe godly perſons, that are ſaid to have lived and died un-baptized, unleſs you will ſuppoſe what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110914:47"/>they received in their infancy to be Baptiſm) I am far from judging them as touching their eternal eſtate, if this ſin of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of theirs, proceeded from ignorance and miſtake, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it did; as I would not judge thoſe who lived and died in Epiſcopal and other Popiſh ſuperſtitions, whileſt otherwiſe truly conſcientious, and men fearing God: Not doubting but that the moſt merciful God, <hi>winked at the dayes of that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and did conſider the great diſadvantages they were under, as coming lately out of that thick darkneſs of Popiſh Apoſtacy and Superſtition, and ſo did accept them, (finding their hearts upright in the main) according <hi>to that light they had, and not according to that they had not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet thirdly, for thoſe perſons fearing God, whether conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as already dead, or as yet living, that were in their times, or that yet remain non-obedient, (not to ſay diſobedient) to this part of the Goſpel, upon occaſion of ſome erronious noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or opinion, by which they have been perſwaded that they have done their duty in refuſing Baptiſm upon the terms in which I plead it, when they have done the contrary; though I will not ſay their ſalvation was, or is deſperately hazarded hereby, yet I do believe it to be much prejudiced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For to what degree Baptiſm when duly uſed, doth by the inſtitutive will and appointment of God, contribute towards the ſalvation of men, (the contributions whereof are doubtleſs very conſiderable this wayes) to the ſame degree muſt they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer prejudice, loſs, and diſadvantage in their ſalvation, who by any erronious opinion about Baptiſm, do wholly deprive themſelves of it, as they do who refuſe the Baptiſm of Gods making, upon a conceit they have it already, when as indeed they have nothing leſs, <hi>If any mans work burn, he ſhall ſuffer loſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of an abundant entrance that ſhall be miniſtred to ſome, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch as have quit themſelves upon excellent terms of diligence, both to know the utmoſt of the will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and to do thereafter, as appears by the Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 9. he doth thereby imply, that to what degree men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and negligent in making enquiry after the will of God,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110914:47"/>touching what they ought to do, or in doing what they know to be his will, to the ſame degree their enterance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, will be contracted, made narrow, and ſtraight, for otherwiſe, if there ſhould not be this different effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon diligence and negligence here about, that would ceaſe to be an Argument or motive unto this diligence, which here the Apoſtle uſes for one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But as for thoſe that are, or ſhall be regardleſs to know the mind of God here about, not ſearching after it, nor conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attending to the means of light and knowledge when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or elſe being under conviction ſhall labour to put out the light in their conſciences, and upon this account ſhall be found diſobedient to this Doctrine of Chriſt, (eſpecially in theſe times wherein the practiſe of it is revived) I ſhall not judge them, (as Chriſt ſpeaks of himſelf; <hi>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not, the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day, John</hi> 7.47, 48.) But ſhall leave them to ſtand or fall by that word which ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: and he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But becauſe I know ſome think themſelves in good and ſafe condition upon their believing, though they be not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, I ſhall thereof deſire ſuch to conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That perſons did believe in the Apoſtles times before they were baptized, &amp; yet Baptiſm was not thereupon the leſs, but the more neceſſary for them. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart thou mayſt,</hi> to wit, <hi>be baptized,</hi> ſaith he to the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. So that faith was then ſo far from being a reaſon why men ſhould not be baptized, as that it was the true reaſon why they ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them further conſider, that that believing which is ſufficient to ones preſent juſtification when he begins to believe, is not ſufficient unto his ſalvation, when he hath the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obeying other Commands of God and doth not. For though <hi>with the heart man believes unto righteouſnes: yet with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 10.10. Though we ſhall ſuppoſe then, that a man believes in Chriſt, and yet ſhall be aſhamed to confeſs him before men, (which it ſeems was the caſe of many of the chief Rulers, <hi>John</hi> 12.42.) Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110914:48"/>will be aſhamed of him before his Father and his holy Angels. So I ſay, if you will ſuppoſe that any man believes in Chriſt, and yet ſhall refuſe to put on Chriſt (is they put him on who are baptized into him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.) either for the ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which the world caſts upon ſuch a practiſe, or for any other carnal reſpect, he may for ought I can from any word of God aſſure him to the contrary, fall ſhort of ſalvation at the laſt, notwithſtanding his preſent belief. <hi>James</hi> 2.14. <hi>What doth it profit, my Brethren, though a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith ſave him? Chriſt is authour of eternal ſalvation, but it is to ſuch as obey him, Heb.</hi> 5.9. And therefore ſayes, <hi>He that ſhall break one of theſe leaſt commands</hi> (as ſome men notion Baptiſm to be,) <hi>and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p>The premiſes conſidered, it is to me matter of wonder as well as of offence, that ſome (who otherwiſe are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the Scriptures) ſhould compare Baptiſm now, with Circumciſion in the Apoſtles dayes, ſaying, that as <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was nothing, nor uncircumciſion nothing, but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandments of God;</hi> ſo to be baptized, or to be un-baptized, is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God is; when as it is the expreſs Doctrine of the Sciptures, a thing urged and preſſed both by Chriſt himſelf, and by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and therefore ſure the Commandment of God. <hi>For I,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak. And I know that his Commandment is life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, (i.e.</hi> being obſerved.) <hi>Whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father hath ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak, John</hi> 12.49, 50. And <hi>Paul</hi> thus: <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet, or ſpirituall, let him acknowledge, that the things that I write unto you, are the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines then of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles, whether delivered in preceptive form, or otherwiſe, are the Commandments of God. But now, to put an Ordinance of God (as Baptiſm is) which is now in force, and will be, I doubt not, to the end of the world, into the ſame capacity with circumciſion in the Apoſtles dayes, the Date whereof was then expired, yea, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110914:48"/>to compare them which preſs the neceſſity of Baptiſm now, with thoſe that preſſed the neceſſity of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, as if the one would render Chriſt as unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them as the other; what is it elſe, then <hi>to make void the Commandment of God, that they might eſtabliſh their own tradition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as no man, that does acknowledg the Authority and Divinity of the Scriptures, can eaſily ſatisfie himſelf in living in the Breach of any of it's known rules and precepts, without the countenance and protection (ſuch as it is) of ſome vain imagination, and deceitful reaſoning or other, ſo is it in this caſe with ſome, who having no mind to this way of God (Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm I mean) though otherwiſe convinced of the nullity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm) have taken hold of certain deluſive Pleas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to juſtifie their non-conformity to this rule of the Goſpel, and Doctrine of Chriſt. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Baptiſm according to Scripture example, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> is not to be adminiſtred to men, but at the time of their firſt believing, and not as now it is practiſed by ſome, long after the time in which they firſt began to believe and profeſſe the Goſpel; nor to any, but ſuch as are Babes in Chriſt, or weak Chriſtians, and not to ſtrong men in Chriſt, or well grown Chriſtians: and that where it is otherwiſe practiſed, there that Baptiſm is not like the Apoſtles Baptiſm; and conſequently is without rule, or example from the Scriptures. And further, that ſince the time of ones new-birth or Babeſhip in Chriſt, is the proper ſeaſon for the reception of Baptiſm, and that <hi>every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon,</hi> that therefore much of the beauty and luſtre of that Ordinance is loſt, when adminiſtred to old Diſciples, and is a thing as uncomely and incongruous, as it is for a man to do an action proper to a child.</p>
            <p>To all which I anſwer, 1. By way of conceſſion, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> and do grant, that the time of mens new-birth or babeſhip in Chriſt, is the fitteſt time and beſt ſeaſon, and the New-born babes in Chriſt, the propereſt ſubject of baptiſmal Adminiſtration: and that it was the uſual cuſtom in the Apoſtles times, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize new Converts, and ſo ought to be practiſed in theſe dayes: all this is that which I have already aſſerted over and over.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:110914:49"/>
            <p>But then ſecondly, I anſwer further by way of Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 1. That it no wayes follows, that becauſe a man both ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly &amp; negligently, however, ſinfully omitted the fitteſt and propereſt ſeaſon of doing that which was his duty in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have done, that therefore he is by that omiſſion of his, diſcharged from and diſobliged to that duty it ſelf. It is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all men, <hi>to remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth, i. e.</hi> begin conſcientiouſly to ſerve God betimes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. but ſhall we ſay, that becauſe youths have let ſlip this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and opportunity of grace, that therefore they are ever a whit the leſs obliged to remember their Creator afterwards, when they come to be old men? Nay, rather on the contrary, does not the greater obligation lie upon them, then, if poſſible, to double their zeal and diligence therein?</p>
            <p>Though the fourteenth day of the firſt month, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time and ſeaſon for the celebration of the Paſſover, by Gods own appointment, as being the preciſe time in which that was done, of which the Paſſover was a memoril, and from which it tock its riſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.17.42. yet if any had omitted it in that appointed ſeaſon, upon occaſion of their being in a journy, or of their being unclean; they were, notwithſtanding that omiſſion, to keep it afterwards on the fourteenth day of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond month, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10, 11. Nay, circumciſion it ſelf, which was but once to be received, though the eighth day after the childs birth, was the proper time of that Ordinance alſo by Gods own injunction, yet when this had been omitted about forty years by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after the appointed and proper time, yet it was not uncomely for them to do that then, which ſhould have been done long before, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.2.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is ſuggeſted as an uncomely thing for old Diſciples to be baptized, and that which tends to take away much of the beauty and luſtre of the Ordinance; I demand, wherein the uncomelineſs lies? Is it any diſparagement to the Ordinance it ſelf, that a tall and well grown man in the things of God otherwiſe, ſhould ſtoop down to it to take it up? or is it any diſparagement for him ſo to do? Indeed it is a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, that he hath neglected his duty ſo long, as all ſin is a diſparagement to him that defiles himſelf with it; but it is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110914:49"/>his honour, that he remembers himſelf at laſt, and obeys his God: acts of conformity to the will of God, adorn the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea a ſubjection to the will of God in this Ordinance, is a comely thing, even in perſons of the greateſt attainments in the things of God. Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, though he was <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this oyl of grace above his fellows,</hi> yet he counted it no diſparagement to him, or uncomely thing in it ſelf for him to be baptized: <hi>Suffer it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be ſo now, for thus it BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COMETH us to fulfil all righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> 3.15. As long then as it is an act of righteouſneſs, or conformity to a Law or Inſtitution of God to be baptized, it can be no uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, no not in one of the growth of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf: but without doubt, it is a fowl diſparagement, and a thing very unſeemly and incongruous to the profeſſion of a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, out of a conceit or vain opinion of high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Chriſtianity, to refuſe to follow his Lord and Maſter through the water, whoſe attainments I am ſure, were then greater when he ſubmitted to this Ordinance, then thine are at the higheſt pitch, who ever thou art that thus vainly diſputeſt with, and fooliſhly <hi>rejecteſt the Counſel of God againſt thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe it is ſaid by way of illuſtration; that for a ſtrong Chriſtian to be baptized, is a thing as incongruous and uncomely, as it is for a luſty man to do an action proper to a child; I demand, whether a man having omitted to do that in his minority, which had been moſt proper for him then to have done, and ſuppoſing the doing of which, would have had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon him, as unto his accommodation and benefit, all the dayes of his life, whether is it an uncomely thing for ſuch a man now ſeeing his former folly in his former neglect, to do that now at laſt in order to his future good, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer neglect whereof he hath ſuſtained too much loſs already? As for example, we know the time of childhood, is the fitteſt time and ſeaſon for the drinking in the firſt rudiments of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet this having been neglected by one in his childhood, and youth, it is ſo far from being an uncomely thing in him to learn to read when he comes to be ſenſible of his want of skill that way, that indeed it is his praiſe and commendations, that he endeavours then to fill up that defect in order to his future
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110914:50"/>benefit. Even ſo, Baptiſm having a ſpiritual influence upon a Chriſtian throughout his whole life, and not only at the time of his firſt taking it up, it therefore follows, that if a man was ſo weak and injudicious in this particular, at the time of his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, as not to judge this Baptiſm we ſpeak of neceſſary, yet for him to ſee his former errour, and to repent of this ignorance, weakneſs, and ſin of his, when he comes to better underſtanding, and reſolve to be no longer without the benefit &amp; bleſſing which God hath put in this Ordinance, for the continuall good and benefit of a Chriſtian all his dayes, is none of his uncomely things, but that which renders him truly wiſe, both in the eyes of God, and good men. It was the duty of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, to repent, and do her firſt works,</hi> having through back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding and decay, fallen beneath them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.5. And ſhall we then think it an uncomely thing, for a man to repent of his former neglect, and now at laſt to do that which ſhould have been his firſt work?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas it is objected, that there is no example in the New Teſtament, as to adminiſter Baptiſm to grown Saints; I anſwer, that if this be true, then it is, becauſe there are no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the New Teſtament of grown Chriſtians their being unbaptized, and ſo no grown Chriſtians that wanted Baptiſm. For that corruption of ſuch a ſinful omiſſion of Baptiſm, was not then crept into the Church, and ſo there was no occaſion or place for ſuch an example. And yet this example we have, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his being baptized long after the time in which he began to fear and ſerve the Lord; for his religion and devotion this way, was of that continuance and ſtanding before his Baptiſm, that it grew famous, as it ſeems, <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Nation of the Jews,</hi> though he himſelf was a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, Acts</hi> 10.1, 2.22. And if thoſe who had been long profeſſors of Chriſtianity, (as it appears they had been of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. in that he ſaith, <hi>For the time they ought to have been teachers,</hi>) had yet <hi>need,</hi> becauſe of their dulneſs, <hi>to be taught again, which were the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God;</hi> then ſurely ſuch as yet never learned all theſe firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but are un-inſtructed in the due uſe of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, which is one of them, and that upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110914:50"/>of their dulneſs this way, have likewiſe need now to learn it practically, though it be not till long after their firſt enterance upon the Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If becauſe we have no examples in Scripture, of old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, their being baptized; I ſay, if this be a reaſon againſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent profeſſors their taking up the Ordinance of Baptiſm, when thitherunto omitted by them, then the like plea, would be as good an argument againſt their being Members of Churches, and their partaking of the Supper of the Lord who are un-baptized; for where is there any example in the New Teſtament of any ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned in Church-fellowſhip, &amp; thereupon partaking of the Supper, who had not been firſt baptized? So that if this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be good for any thing, it is to beat down both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Ordinances; a thing which would doubtleſs much gratifie thoſe that already ſit too looſe that way, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome that have uſed this way of reaſoning, did not ſo well conſider, whil'ſt they build up with one hand, what they endeavour to throw down with the other.</p>
            <p>But about a work of reformation after a great Apoſtacy and general defection from the purity of Goſpel-worſhip, and Adminiſtration, it is no good way of reaſoning, to ſay, that becauſe we have no examples in Scripture of ſuch and ſuch endeavours of reformation of abuſes crept into the worſhip of God, therefore we may not thus and thus endeavour it. In ſuch caſes, it is ſufficient that we have the Original rule to direct us, what it is that God did require of his people when he firſt delivered them thoſe laws and rules to walk by, and that we endeavour practically to anſwer theſe, as near as the poſſibility of our preſent condition will admit; and not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect them, upon a pretence of an impoſſibility in us, by reaſon of diſadvantage contracted, to anſwer the firſt accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner and uſage, in ſuch or ſuch Ordinances and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in all particular circumſtances. If the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their coming out of their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, had gone this way to work, they had never ſet upon the work of reformation, and reſtitution of Temple and Worſhip, as indeed they did. For they had no example before them, of that which they were now to do: <hi>viz.</hi> to re-build the Temple, and reſtore the Decays
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110914:51"/>of worſhip, in thoſe particular caſes and circumſtances pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them, no, not any particular direction from the law, in ſeveral of their immergencies, but only general rules of original Order and Inſtitution. And yet upon the authority of thoſe Laws, by which God at the firſt enjoyned the erection of a Temple, and the uſe of ſuch and ſuch Ordinances, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to re-edifie the one, and reſtore the other from under their decays and diſcontinuance,<note place="margin">Ezra 3.</note> though in the doing thereof, they had no more Prophets, or other extraordinary means to direct them, then we have now in our work of reformation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Goſpel-worſhip and order. And yet that in thus doing, they did nothing but what was their duty, appears by this, in that when they deſiſted from the work, and God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up two Prophets, <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> they down-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprove them from the Lord for letting their hand ſlack from the work, and not proceeding as they had begun, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2.4. &amp;c. Which clearly argues, that it was their duty to have gone on, as well as to have begun, though God had raiſed them up no extraordinary Prophets to aſſiſt them; and that their firſt endeavours herein, were approved of God, as their after dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings were reproved by him. And therefore, theſe things well conſidered, I ſhould rather think, that ſuch perſons, who having begun, and made ſome good progreſs in the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwiſe, but in this of Baptiſm ſlack their hands from the work, ſhould much rather expect to be ſharply reproved from God with theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> for being partial and remiſs in this work of the Lord, then to be indulged in the neglect of this duty upon a pretence that the ſeaſon thereof is over with them. <hi>This people ſay,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the time is not yet come, the time in which the Lords houſe ſhould be built, Hag.</hi> 1.2. But our preſent Oppoſers, err on the other hand, ſaying, the time is now paſt, in which the Lords Baptiſm ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them.</p>

               <p>ANother pretence againſt their receiving Baptiſm who have anciently profeſſed themſelves ſervants to Jeſus Chriſt otherwiſe, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe by ſuch a long continued courſe of profeſſion, the ends for which Baptiſm was wont to be received, are prevented. For Baptiſm being a Chriſtians viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſition or paſſing from under his former profeſſion, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip, and converſation, into a new condition in theſe reſpects, and that whereby he does engage to renounce, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and diſclaim the former, but to continue conſtant in the worſhipping, ſerving and obeying him, into whoſe Name he is baptized; hence it comes to paſs, that when any men or women have by a continued, conſtant, and publick profeſſion of repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, and love towards men, given up their names to God, and to Jeſus Chriſt, and declared themſelves his ſervants; hence it comes to paſs, ſay they, that the foreſaid ends and uſes of Baptiſm are ſufficiently provided for by ſuch a profeſſion, and conſequently Baptiſm to ſuch is needleſs, and unneceſſary, becauſe Baptiſm, as all other things, is neceſſary only in reſpect of the ends whereto it ſerves; and therefore where the ends of it are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it ſelf being the means, ceaſes to be any further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

                  <head>The Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, 1. By demanding, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>1</label> that if the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or the ſame things for the ſake of which Baptiſm was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, could be attained by a Chriſtian profeſſion without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, how came it to paſs then that God did ever inſtitute and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Baptiſm at all? For ſuch a Chriſtian profeſſion as is ſpoken of, will be granted, I ſuppoſe, to be every mans duty, whether he be baptized or no. And ſurely where the ſame end is ſufficiently provided for by one means, God is not wont to ſuper-adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110914:52"/>for he makes nothing in vain. It is upon this principle of truth I conceive, that the Apoſtle argues the inſufficiency of the Law to accompliſh the ſame end for which the Goſpel is given, <hi>viz.</hi> in that he did ordain and make the Goſpel, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the being of the Law. <hi>If there had been a Law given, which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law, Gal.</hi> 3.21. And again, <hi>If that firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond, Heb.</hi> 8.7. Upon the ſame account may we ſay, If the ſame ends which God intends to bring about by Baptiſm, could have been attained (upon the ſame terms of wiſdom and goodneſs) by the Chriſtian profeſſion mentioned, and by this only, then he would never have leavied this other means of Baptiſm too for the ſame purpoſe: it argues weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in thoſe that out-match their ends with means. And therefore to ſay, that the ends of Baptiſm may be as commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attained without Baptiſm in the Chriſtian profeſſion as with it, is to reflect a foul diſparagement upon the wiſdom of God in his inſtituting and making Baptiſm, or giving it any being at all. <hi>But let God be true, and every man a lyar,</hi> and let the fooliſhneſs of God be eſteemed (as indeed it is) wiſer then men; and ſo let the ſhame and diſparagement which ſome have unawares thus fooliſhly caſt upon God, fall upon their own hearts and faces in humiliation before him with whom they have been ſo un-becomingly bold.</p>
                  <p>But ſecond. I demand further, how it comes to paſs that Baptiſm and the profeſſion of Chriſtianity are divided, and that Baptiſm is excluded the Chriſtian profeſſion? For what do they elſe ſay in effect, who ſay the ends of Baptiſm are attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Chriſtian Profeſſion without Baptiſm? For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would make the Chriſtian Profeſſion intirely compleat as to the production of all its ends without Baptiſm, and ſo conſequently render Baptiſm no eſſentiall part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion; a thing directly contrary to the ſtream and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture, which derives its petty-gree from the ſame Authour with, and aſſignes its place and ſtanding among other the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt of which the Chriſtian profeſſion doth principally conſiſt.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:110914:52"/>
                  <p n="3">3. I yet anſwer further, by denying that the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are adequately attained by any continued courſe of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatſoever without Baptiſm; and do ſay on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that perſons not having as yet been baptized, though of the greateſt attainments in religion otherwiſe, do ſtand in need of Baptiſm, as to the effecting the ends thereof: and this I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert upon theſe grounds and conſiderations following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as well Baptiſm as a mans entrance upon, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Chriſtianity, is appointed by God as a means of effecting the ſame end, to wit, ſalvation. This hath been already made manifeſt from thoſe Scriptures, where perſons have been dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the uſe of baptiſm as well as repentance, in order to their being faved, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. The like conjunction is made between believing and baptiſm, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. And between regeneration and baptiſm, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and between a good conſcience and baptiſm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. and all in order to the ſame common end, ſalvation. Now where ſeveral means are enjoyned men by God in order to the obtaining the ſame end, there it is not ſafe for any that really deſire that end, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any one of thoſe means upon any pretence whatſoever, nor in caſe of ſuch an omiſſion, does God ſtand obliged by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his, to confer the grace and benefit of ſalvation, nor can ſuch in that caſe with any ſufficient ground of confidence, expect it at his hands. Effects depending upon the concurrance and co-operation of ſeveral cauſes, are not to be expected upon the operation of part of them only. As there are ſeveral ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that go to the making up of one word, ſo there are ſeveral things which by the appointment of God go to the making of a man regularly capable of ſalvation, as repentance, faith, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, obedience, &amp;c. So that as he that propounds to himſelf the writing of ſuch or ſuch a word conſiſting of ſeveral ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, diſappoints himſelf of his end in omitting any one of them; ſo he that propounds the putting of himſelf into a regular capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſalvation as his end, and yet voluntarily omits any one of the means appointed by God for that purpoſe, takes a like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſe to diſappoint himſelf of this great and important end of his, <hi>viz.</hi> his regular capacity of ſalvation. If God ſhall pleaſe to ſave any man upon eaſier terms then thoſe which he hath ſet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110914:53"/>as his ordinary and ſtanding method, and upon which he hath obliged himſelf by promiſe and covenant to ſave men, I ſhall not (ſo far as I know mine own heart) be troubled at it; but ſhall adviſe all men that prize their ſalvation, not to truſt to that, but to expect ſalvation from God upon his own propoſed terms, that is in a way of doing that which he requires of men in order thereunto, as <hi>David</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and done thy Commandments, Pſal.</hi> 119.166. Faith obtains at the hands of God, not ſimply by believing that God will do this or that good thing which he hath promiſed, but by putting him in whom it is upon obeying God in the uſe of ſuch means, upon the condition or taking place whereof he hath made ſuch promiſe; as likewiſe, by depending upon the power, goodneſs, and faithfulneſs of God for performance, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and obediential uſe of the ſaid means. It is ſaid, that it was by faith, that the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.30. but how? not in omitting any one of thoſe things which God enjoyned for that purpoſe, though otherwiſe very deſpicable and unlikely to produce ſuch an effect. And it may very well be queſtioned, whether thoſe walls would have fallen down as they did if they had compaſſed the City but ſix times when he had enjoyned ſeven, or otherwiſe had omitted the blowing of the ſame horns, or any other piece of Solemnity which God had commanded as a Sacramental means of atchieving that great enterpriſe, though otherwiſe, there was no proportion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural efficiency in thoſe actions, to produce any ſuch effect, when intirely performed. But the faith and obedience of men to God, is many times more ſeen in doing this or that at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reference to an end, which in it ſelf promiſes nothing towards ſuch a production, then it is in doing greater matters that ſeem more proportionate to their end, becauſe in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is a ſigne that God is more eyed, then the means. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as doubtleſs, it is a great temptation upon men, and oft proves a ſtumbling block in their way, to deſpiſe and ſo to neglect the uſe of ſuch means as through the inſtitution of God would rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce to their good, becauſe they promiſe ſo little in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance. This was the cauſe why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at Chriſt himſelf, when they ſaw the lowneſs of his condition in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110914:53"/>the world; this likewiſe cauſed them to prefer works before faith as to their juſtification. This was the ſtone at which <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> began to ſtumble, when he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to waſh ſeven times in Jorden</hi> for the clenſing of his leproſie, ſuppoſing that to be an unlikely thing to produce that effect: <hi>I had thought,</hi> (ſaith he concerning <hi>Eliſha</hi>) <hi>that ſurely he would have come out me, and have ſtood, and called on the Name of the Lord his God, and have ſtruck his hand over the place: are not Abana and Pharper, rivers of Damaſcus, better then all the waters in Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.11, 12. And indeed, I much fear, that the feet of many who other-wayes are godly and wiſe, are taken in this very ſnare of under-valuing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeming the Ordinance of Baptiſm, becauſe it is a thing, which according to outward appearance, is deſpicable, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo little. For from what elſe can thoſe dimunitive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome concerning it proceed? who ſay, that if it be a duty for Chriſtians not to baptize their children, and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized themſelves; yet it is one of the leaſt of duties among ten thouſand. And as it was from that low eſteem which <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had of his waſhing in <hi>Jorden</hi> ſeven times, and the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of it in his eye to effect his clenſing, that made him to ſay, Are not <hi>Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damaſcus, better then the waters of Iſraels</hi> So doubtleſs is it from the like low eſteem which they have of this Ordinance of Chriſt, that ſome conceive, that the other parts of the Chriſtian profeſſion, are likelier to produce the effects aſsigned to Baptiſm, then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm it ſelf is. But as many times great weights do hang on ſmall wyers, ſo, the wiſdom of God hath put much as to the good of men, in thoſe very things which many times ſeem leaſt in the eyes of men, that the excellency of the treaſure and benefit, may ſo much the more manifeſtly be known to be of God, by how much the veſſel is earththy and weak, in which it is brought.</p>
                  <p>And wherefore have I thus inlarged? but to ſhew, that Baptiſm by water, however by mens miſ-repreſentation of the matter to themſelves, it ſeems to be numbred among the leaſt of the Commands of God, or rather excluded their number as to the profeſſors of theſe dayes, yet being enjoyned by the ſame
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110914:54"/>Lord, in the ſame Goſpel, in order to the ſalvation of men, as well as repentance from dead works, and faith towards God; and that God doth no more exempt or priviledge any man from the one, then he does from the other, by any word of his, or does any whit more aſcertain his ſalvation in the neglect of the one, then he does in the neglect of the other, that therefore it is of mans weakneſs and vanity, and not from any wiſdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God, to make ſuch an election and reprobation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Doctrines of Chriſt as ſome do, who while they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the one abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, yet do in the mean while with another eye, look upon the other as indifferent, needleſs, and ſuperfluous, as touching any ſuch need which the ſalvation of men hath thereof; yea judging them deeply culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (almoſt as much as they who ſaid, <hi>Except ye be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ye cannot be ſaved</hi>) that urge the practiſe of Baptiſm as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, though in the doing thereof, they put no other neceſſity upon it, then what the Scripture hath put.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As there is one common end of believing, repenting, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, growing in grace, and perſevering to the end, which is ſalvation; ſo there are ſubordinately, ſeveral different ends of Baptiſm it ſelf: and there is alſo a gradual acceſſion to thoſe ends; in both which reſpects, Baptiſm is neceſſary in perſons otherwiſe of the largeſt growth in religion. For though it ſhould be granted for arguments ſake, that ſome of the ends of Baptiſm may be prevented, by a long continued courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion preceding it; yet that any ſhould affirm, that all the ends of Baptiſm are anticipitated by ſuch a profeſſion, me thinks is ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Baptiſm in the uſe, influence, and operation of it, runs parallel with a mans life and dayes; ſo that though the act be tranſient, yet the Spirit or obliging power of that act, is or ought to be permanent and laſting. For what ever a man by his baptiſm does ingage himſelf to; this baptiſmal engagement of his, if the intent of it be obſerved, hath an influence upon him all his dayes, to walk anſwerable to it. And ſo we ſhall find the Apoſtle teaching the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> to improve their Baptiſm which they had received long before, unto their then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110914:54"/>preſent mortification and ſanctification, anſwerable to the true intent of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5. As a wife ought all her dayes, to remember and keep that engagement of fidelity to her husband, into which ſhe entred the day of her marriage, ſo ought a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to make it his continual work, and daily buſineſs, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, fulfil, and make good, that engagement of ſubjection and fidelity to Chriſt Jeſus, into which he entred at the time of his Baptiſm. So that this then running parallel with a Chriſtians profeſſion, influencing and acting the ſame, it cannot poſsibly be prevented by ſuch a profeſsion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One end of Baptiſm is to confirm, ſtrengthen and increaſe in men, that which in ſome good meaſure they had before they were baptized. Men either do or ought to believe before they are baptized, as hath been already ſhewed, and yet they are to be baptized for the bettering and confirmation of that faith of theirs notwithſtanding. So men have ſome preſence and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit before Baptiſm, in as much as they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to believe before. <hi>For no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord,</hi> (as they do that believe before Baptiſm) <hi>but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. And yet Baptiſm is to be received for this end among others, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may receive the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> a greater meaſure and preſence of the Spirit then before they had, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. Now then, unleſs that any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors can come forth and ſay, that they have ſo much faith, and ſo much of the Spirit, that they need no more; I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how their profeſsion, though otherwiſe never ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and real, can carry them above their need of Baptiſm. Certainly, they have outſtript <hi>Paul,</hi> either in proficiency, or in opinion of their own worth, who can ſay they have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, perfection of degrees. <hi>Not as though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, either were already perfect, ſayes Paul, Philip.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Now that Baptiſm, ought to be received in relation to ſome of its ends, though others of them ſhould be prevented by ſome precedanious work of grace, or gift of God, will appear. 1. From the example of our Saviours Baptiſm, who though he had no need of baptiſm, in reſpect of ſome of thoſe ends for which Baptiſm was ordained, and in reſpect whereof all other men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110914:55"/>needed it, yet in ſome other reſpects, we ſee it was neceſſary even in Chriſt himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> as it was a thing, well becoming him to fulfil all righteouſneſs, and to obey God in this, as in all other his Commands and Inſtitutions then on foot, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. 2. It appears from the Baptiſm of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Company. For though one end of Baptiſm, is to put men into a regular capacity of receiving the Holy Ghoſt, as hath been noted; yet God preventing this end of baptiſm as unto them, in cauſing the Holy Ghoſt to fall upon them extraordinarily, while the word of the Goſpel was in ſpeaking to them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized; the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hereupon, is ſo far from making this an Argument why they ſhould not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or had no need of Baptiſm, as that he thence infers the reaſonableneſs of the thing, why they ſhould be baptized in reference to other ends, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47, 48. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might alſo from what hath been now laſt mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
                     </label> take occaſion to anſwer another Objection againſt the continuation of Baptiſm in theſe dayes; which Objection is this, That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews, that Baptiſm now produces no ſuch effects, as it did in the Apoſtles dayes; for then thoſe that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with water, were baptized alſo with the Spirit, ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects thereof frequently enſuing. But no ſuch effects are now produced by that Baptiſm which men take up in our days; for what have they more of the Spirit who are baptized, with this new baptiſm (as they call it) then thoſe that are not? and if they have no more, then to what purpoſe is the practiſe of it continued?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                     </label> 1. That by what hath been juſt now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved about the baptiſm of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, it appears that baptiſm is neceſſary for other ends, then to render men capable of thoſe extraordinary receptions of the Spirit. For we there ſee, that baptiſm was neceſſary to them though they had been prevented herewith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this Objection were forcible againſt the being of true
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110914:55"/>baptiſm now in the world, it might be to as good purpoſe an objection againſt the being of any true believers in the world, at leaſt ſo far as known to us: For there are no ſuch effects, as a miraculous ſpeaking with tongues, &amp;c. that follow mens believing in theſe dayes, which yet were promiſed to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and received by them in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17.</p>
                  <p>But as the ordinary and common effects of believing, to wit, obedience, love, &amp;c. do now follow mens believing, as well as they did in the Apoſtles dayes, though thoſe extraordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are ceaſed, or at leaſt ſuſpended, as having been vouchſafed for a certain time only, by way of ſpecial diſpenſation, &amp; deſigne for the confirmation of the Goſpel-miniſtration whileſt it was but yet new, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. So do the ordinary, common, and indeed moſt ſalvivical effects of baptiſm where duly uſed, now remain, when as thoſe that were extraordinary, and by way of extraordinary deſigne, and of ſpecial diſpenſation, for a time voucſafed are now ceaſed, or at leaſt ſuſpended.</p>
                  <p>Neither were thoſe gifts which we call extraordinary, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in point of ſaving benefit, above thoſe which we call ordinary, nor indeed equal to them: for the Apoſtle having ſpoken of theſe extraordinary gifts, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. concludes thus in <hi>ver.</hi> laſt; <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts, and yet ſhew I unto you a more excellent way:</hi> And what was that more excellent way, but the way of Chriſtian love and charity, of which he ſpeaks in the following <hi>Chapter:</hi> the which if wanting, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man <hi>had the tongue of men and Angels, and the gift of Propheſie, and faith to remove mountains, yet he would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but as a ſounding braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1.2.</p>
                  <p>But 3. whereas it is demanded; what have they more of the Spirit who are baptized, then thoſe who are not? Though I believe they will not boaſt of their meaſures of the Spirit, yet I dare ſay, that if they have not a greater preſence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them then others have, <hi>to acquaint them with the things freely given them of God, to mortifie the deeds of the body, to luſt againſt the deeds of the fleſh, to crucifie their affections and luſts to the old world, to guid them in the wayes of truth, to help their
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110914:56"/>infirmities in prayer,</hi> to ſtrengthen them to ſuffer, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them in ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake, and to fill them with that joy and peace, which is unſpeakable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it is not becauſe theſe and the like bleſſed effects of the Spirit, are not deducible from God by baptiſm, if rightly improved, but it is, becauſe they either reſt in the work done, or do not exerciſe faith about the Ordinance, and the promiſe of God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, or elſe do not frequently and ſeriouſly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God for theſe ſupplyes from it, not ſtudy how they may all their dayes make the beſt improvement of it: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this Ordinance is not barren, nor is that a vain word which aſſures men of the Spirit that obey God herein.

But I would demand of the conſciences of ſuch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiſm were ever at any time an Ordinance of the New Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt or no? And whether that New Teſtament in which Baptiſm hath its place &amp; ſtanding, were not the laſt Will and Teſtament of Chriſt? And if ſo, as I ſuppoſe it will not be denied ſo to have been; then whether it be not intolerable preſumption and boldneſs for any man to alter the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110914:56"/>laſt Will and Teſtament of the Lord, and to wipe out Baptiſm which he hath left as part of the Legacy of his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Though it be but a mans teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſanulleth, or addeth thereto, Gal.</hi> 3.15. And ſhould vain man make more bold with his Redeemer and Soveraign Lord, by whom he muſt be ſhortly judged, then the moſt ordinary ingenuity will ſuffer him to do with men, when they are dead and gone? Or if they will ſay, that Chriſt Jeſus himſelf hath made any alteration in this behalf, or that he ever did appropriate Baptiſm to the elder brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive believers, with the excluſion of the younger brethren, to wit, thoſe other believers, which in their ſucceſſive generations have been, are, and ſhall be <hi>Partakers of like precious faith,</hi> and of the ſame <hi>common ſalvation</hi> with them, let them ſhew it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they require our belief of it.</p>
                  <p>But if they will believe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, (which is ſure to be believed before them) he teſtifies concerning ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Rules, Precepts, Laws, and Ordinances, as thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Apoſtolical Churches then had and did enjoy, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould be <hi>HELD FAST</hi> by the Churches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Churches, <hi>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others were looking after other doctrines then what they had been taught by Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles, yet ſays he, As for you that have not this doctrine, that are not yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with any new doctrine, I will impoſe no further bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon you, then the keeping of thoſe things which you have been already taught, and have received: but as for theſe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110914:57"/>ſaid he, <hi>Hold them faſt till I come.</hi> As it was the will and Command of Chriſt, that that Church in the ſucceſſion of its members, ſhould have continued a pure and uncorrupted Church until he ſhould come again, ſo it was his will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that what ever Ordinances they then had, (and ſurely Baptiſm was not yet extinct according to our Adverſaries own opinion, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> being yet alive,) the ſame were to be held faſt by them, in the pure uſe of them, even until his ſecond coming alſo.</p>
                  <p>For Goſpel Ordinances, (among which Baptiſm at leaſt in the Apoſtles dayes, is acknowledged to be one,) did not die with the Apoſtles, but as the Apoſtles were to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the ſame things they themſelves had learned from Chriſt, <hi>(Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, Matth.</hi> 28.20.) So thoſe that ſucceeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, were to tranſmit and carry over the ſame things to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſhould come after them, which they themſelves had learned from the Apoſtles. And not only ſo, but thoſe alſo of the ſecond remove from the Apoſtles, were to hand over the ſame things to the next Generation to them, and ſo from one generation to another, till Chriſt ſhall come again to put an end to this Goſpel miniſtration, as at his firſt coming he did put a period to the Legal. <hi>The things that thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Juſt as it was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, when God had firſt given them the Law and the Ordinances thereof by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes:</hi> thoſe Ordinances did not ceaſe when <hi>Moſes</hi> ceaſed to be any more among them, but one generation was to inſtruct and teach another the knowledge and obſervation of thoſe Laws and Ordinances, until the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 6, 7. <hi>For he eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our fathers, that they ſhould make them known to their children: that the generation to come might know them, even the children who ſhould be born: who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his Commandments.</hi> The Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110914:57"/>of Chriſt then, being ratified in his blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. He that ſhall go about to diſanul or alter it, to put out and put in at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and to ſay this part of it remains in force, and that does not, as touching ſuch things as at the firſt were enjoyned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as Chriſtians; though it ſhould be <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, or an Angel from Heaven that ſhould do it, the Apoſtles would have ſuch an one to be eſteemed accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19.</p>
                  <p>And there is great reaſon why the Spirit of God, and the Servants of God, ſhould be ſo ſevere againſt thoſe alterations in the Will and Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, which perhaps ſome men may count matters of no great moment, becauſe by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Authority of any one Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt in the minds of men, the whole Goſpel is in danger of being thereby undermined, as touching its credit and authority with them: For as the ſaying is in the civil Law, <hi>He that hath wronged one, hath threatned many:</hi> Or rather as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> hath it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> So verily, they whoever they be, that deny the continuation of Baptiſm in the Church, do in effect deny all the Ordinances of the Goſpel, yea, and the Goſpel it ſelf too, (as too many now a dayes have done; who at firſt began, but where thoſe Antibaptiſts do begin,) becauſe all the reſt, both Doctrine and Ordinances, ſtand but upon the ſame foundation, and by the ſame authority as Baptiſm it ſelfe does: And he that thinks he may make bold to ſlight the one, hath as much reaſon (which is none at all duly ſo called) to proceed to deſpiſe the other; and it is a thouſand to one, but if the Devil be too hard for him in the one, he will not leave him till he hath brought him to the other.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to ſuch as are nibling and tampering with this or any other ſacred Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, by way of queſtioning its authority and perpetuity; my advice to ſuch ſhall be in this caſe, the ſame which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives in another, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife, is as when one letteth out water; therefore leave off contention, before it be medled with;</hi> Ceaſe betimes all your queſtioning of, quarrelling and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt this Ordinance of Baptiſm, or any other divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110914:58"/>For if you once give liberty and way to your ſelves, to queſtion the Divinity, Authority, or Perpetuity of any one Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, you no more know where you ſhall make an end, then he that opens a little breach to the Sea, knows what its progreſs will be, or how far it will ſpread.</p>
                  <p>Let this then ſuffice, as touching the reſolution of that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be neceſſary for ſuch perſons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as have of a long time been profeſſors of the Goſpel, they not having been baptized ſooner, as they ought to have been?</p>

Yet when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what reaſons and motives are found in the other ballance, I muſt acknowledge, my reaſon and judgment carry it againſt my affection, to give my advice in the negative: which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, motives, or conſiderations, are theſe, and ſuch as theſe which here follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Baptiſm is one of the foundation Doctrines upon which a right conſtituted Church is built. That the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets is the foundation of a Church of Chriſt, in which himſelf is the <hi>chief corner-ſtone,</hi> is evident from what the Apoſtle aſſerts concerning the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in this behalfe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>Now therefore, ye are no more ſtrangers and forrainers, but Fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, what Doctrines of Chriſt, &amp; of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles they are, which are the foundation of a Church? (for it is in reſpect of their Doctrine, I conceive, that the Apoſtles are called, the foundation,) we ſhall find them particularly reckoned up by the Apoſtle, as thoſe upon which the Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was built, (which was indeed the firſt Church of Chriſt conſtituted by the Apoſtles, whileſt they were yet together, preſently after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt; and therefore a rule and pattern to all ſucceeding Churches,) and they are theſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDATION of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the Doctrines of Baptiſms, and of the laying on of hands, and of reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement.</hi> Now in this enumeration of foundation doctrines, we have baptiſm in the lift, as well as repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, and ſo the reſt. When the Apoſtle ſaid, not laying again the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of repentance, &amp;c. It is hereby manifeſt, that repentance, faith, baptiſm, &amp;c. had been formerly laid as the foundation of that <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church, for ſo theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> were, as you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110914:59"/>may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.6. and 10.24.25. and 13.7.17.24.</p>
               <p>If then the Doctrine of Baptiſm practically imbraced, was a part of the foundation of the firſt Churches, which were moſt exactly built according to the direction of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, whoſe houſe they were, and that it was the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, that ſo it ſhould be, for ſo I conceive it was, in which reſpect Baptiſm, as the reſt there mentioned, is called both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and foundation, <hi>i. e.</hi> a foundation laid according to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: I ſay, this conſidered, it neerly concerns all thoſe that put to their hands to erect and conſtitute a Church unto Chriſt, to do what ever they do there in as much as in them lies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Original Pattern given by God, and that in building they leave out no part of his foundation. <hi>Other foundations</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Church-building) <hi>can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. that is, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in his doctrine; <hi>for he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath Chriſt, as he that abideth not in his Doctrine, hath him not,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. According to which, we may alſo ſay, that they who lay not the Doctrine of Chriſt for a foundation, do not lay Chriſt for the ſoundation, Upon which account, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> is denyed to be a true Church, though Chriſt in his Perſon is owned amongſt them. But when I ſay, Chriſt in his Doctrine is the foundation, other then which no man can lay. I do not mean Chriſt in all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Doctrines, as if there could be no true foundation where every Doctrine of Chriſt is not received I but according to the Apoſtle in this behalf, I mean Chriſt in ſuch of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are called the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, or the beginning Word of Chriſt; which principles, are called the foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. This then being the foundation laid by the Apoſtles, other foundation, ſaid he, can no man lay, <hi>i. e.</hi> with any commiſſion or approbation from God.</p>
               <p>We know when <hi>Moſes</hi> was to build a Tabernacle unto God, his ſtrict charge from God, was to do every thing there about according to the pattern which God had ſhewed him: <hi>Look,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou make them after their pattern, which was ſhewed thee in the Mount, Exod.</hi> 25.40. And ſo afterwards, when <hi>Solomon</hi> was to build a Temple to God, he likewiſe was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110914:59"/>to do it <hi>according to the pattern which David had received by the Spirit,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>and which he was made to underſtand in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by the hand of God upon him,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11, 12, 19. And doubtleſs there is not leſs exactneſs, ſedulity, and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be uſed now in times of the Goſpel in building a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe unto God, then was under the Law in thoſe that were typical. For as Chriſt is faithful in all his houſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all things belonging to his houſe, as was <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 3.2. <hi>viz.</hi> in his directions how he would have it built, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs thereof ordered, as he received of his Father, ſo ought the ſervants of Chriſt to be as faithful alſo in following their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal pattern. For that exactneſs under the Law, ſerved as an example or ſhadow of Heavenly things, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpiritual or Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Who ſerve unto the example and ſhadow of heavenly things, as Moſes was admoniſhed of God, when he was about to make the Tabernacle: For ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou make all things according to the pattern ſhewed to thee on the Mount.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As it was a Doctrine of Chriſt, delivered by the Apoſtles, that Churches ſhould be founded upon Baptiſm as well as other principles of the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, that men ſhould firſt be baptized, and then aſſociate themſelves in Church Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo in the ſecond place, we ſhall find it to have been the practiſe of believers, and ſuch as ſubjected themſelves to the Doctrine of the Goſpel in the Apoſtles time. The firſt Church that was erected by the Apoſtles, I mean the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> obſerved this method, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40, 42. <hi>Thoſe that gladly received his word, were baptized,</hi> and here upon <hi>the ſame day were added to them,</hi> viz. to the Apoſtles, and other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>about three thouſand ſouls:</hi> and then it follows, that <hi>they continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi> 1. They gladly received the word. 2. Were baptized. 3. Were added to the <hi>Church.</hi> 4. Continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and prayers. So, that as their gladſom receiving the word, preceded their baptiſm, ſo did their baptiſm in reſpect of order, precede their addition to that particular body of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and their communion and fellowſhip together in the Ordinances of the Goſpel, as breaking of bread, and the like.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:110914:60"/>
               <p>The Apoſtle gives thanks to God in the behalf of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Romans:</hi> For that though they had been <hi>the ſervants of ſin, yet had obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine whereto they were delivered,</hi> as it is in the Marginal reading, <hi>i. e.</hi> unto the profeſſion and practice of which they were delivered, when they firſt turned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp; were baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. For that now is evident, that what ever this form of Doctrine was, it was ſuch doctrine as was firſt taught them, &amp; firſt believed &amp; obeyed by them upon their becoming <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For it was at that time in which they ceaſed to be any longer the ſervants of fin, and did become the Servants of righteouſneſs, (which muſt needs be the time of their converſion) in which they are ſaid to have obeyed that <hi>Form of Doctrine.</hi> Now what reaſonably can be imagined to be the forme of doctrine here ſpoken of, which was ſubjected to at their firſt converſion, but that which the Scripture elſewhere calls, (as we have already noted) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning doctrine of Chriſt, or <hi>the Principles of the Drctrine of Chriſt,</hi> or that Syſteme, body, or platform of doctrine which was made up of thoſe ſix Principles, wherein men were firſt inſtructed, and which were laid as a foundation of what ever might be called a progreſs in Chriſtianity afterwards? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. Theſe believing <hi>Romans</hi> then, did not only obey the doctrine of the Goſpel ſimply conſidered, and in the general, but alſo in the formality of it, or according to that method and order which does appertain to the laws &amp; precepts of it, of which an account was before given. That believers were baptized before their admittance into <hi>Church</hi> communion, and in order to it, is clear enough; but that any were admitted to <hi>Church-Fellowſhip</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm in the Primitive times, is a thing which to me no where appears from the Scripture, but is a thing void of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or example from Scripture, in thoſe that now practiſe it.</p>
               <p>If then it was the practiſe of believers in the firſt times of the Goſpel, to aſſociate themſelves in <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> with ſuch only who were baptized; a great inducement doubtleſs it ought to be, to all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now to go and do likewiſe. For the Scripture-injunction is, <hi>To walk in the way of good men, and to keep in the path of the righteous, Prov.</hi> 2.20. <hi>To be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110914:60"/>of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes, Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>To mark them which walked as the Apoſtles walked, as having them for an Enſample, Philip.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. And it was the great praiſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they made the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> (which were <hi>Churches</hi> of the firſt Plantation,) their pattern and example, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For ye, brethren, became followers of the Churches of God, which in Judea are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> and what was praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in that <hi>Church,</hi> will be commendable to any <hi>Church</hi> now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> None are in a due and regular capacity of holding <hi>Church-Communion</hi> with a particular <hi>Church</hi> in her appropriate privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,, who are not regularly viſible members of the univerſal <hi>Church:</hi> as no man is in a due capacity of being a member of a particular <hi>Corporation</hi> in a Nation, who not being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, is not firſt made a free Denizen of that Nation. For particular <hi>Churches</hi> receive their reſpective beings from the Univerſal, as particular Rivers receive theirs from the Sea.</p>
               <p>That Baptiſm is the Ordinance of viſible initiation or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the univerſal <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a thing which generally hath been acknowledged, and is by Pedobaptiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſtantly aſſerted, and is that which I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former part of this Treatiſe from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. to which I refer the Reader for ſatisfaction herein. What perſons are, or may be in Gods account and acceptation, upon account of their faith and repentance, &amp;c. preceding their baptiſm, is not the thing in queſtion, (if it were, I hope I ſhould not be found too narrow and ſtraight, in my Chriſtian allowance as unto that,) but the queſtion is, what they are viſibly unto men, when they make a judgement of them according to rule. And if Baptiſm be the means of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble admiſſion into the <hi>Church,</hi> and of viſible ingrafting into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then this end is not to be expected without this means, where there is opportunity of making uſe of it; God never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to vouchſafe things in an extraordinary way, when or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means are at hand, and neglected; and conſequently, that none are to be looked upon as regularly viſible members,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110914:61"/>no not of the Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> who are not baptized. For men are not left to their own liberty herein, but are tied up to a rule to judg by. And indeed ſhould there not be a certain ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule, ſuch as Baptiſm is, by which to determine when men are viſibly of the <hi>Church</hi> univerſal, and when not, there would be a great deal of uncertainty, by what, how, and when to eſteem them members thereof.</p>
               <p>Should we make any thing elſe the rule of this Judgement, we ſhould find our ſelves at a ſtrange loſs to give right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein. For example, Should we make a mans profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian Religion in general this rule; then the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be, whether every profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion does render a man reputably a member of the univerſal <hi>Church?</hi> If not (as I ſuppoſe it will not be aſſerted that it doth) then the queſtion will be, to what degree a man muſt profeſs before he be worthy that denomination? And who is able here to give the rule unto his brother? yea, or unto himſelf either? but that he will be in danger of making it too high, or too low, too narrow, or too wide. But now, if we take the rule which God hath fitted to our hands, (Baptiſm I mean) we ſhall then find our ſelves delivered from thoſe uncertainties, difficulties, and diſ-ſatisfactions, yea from that un-evangelical arbitrarineſs in the things of God, which otherwiſe will of neceſſity and unavoidably befall us herein. For according to Scripture rule, all they, and only they are to be eſteemed viſibly of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Church,</hi> who ſo far profeſs repentance from dead works, faith towards God, and the reſt of the foundation principles, as thereupon to ſubmit to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, as enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves thereby, to be no longer the ſervants of ſin, but thenceforth the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, and of righteouſneſs: I ſhall not here repeat the proof of this, you have it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>If then none are to be eſteemed as viſible members of the univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> but only ſuch as are baptized, then none but ſuch as are baptized may be admitted as members of a particular <hi>Church.</hi> For it is altogether irregular, indeed abſurd, to admit any into particular <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> who are not firſt viſibly members of the Univerſal; becauſe particular <hi>Churches,</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110914:61"/>ſo particular Church-members, receive their right of being ſuch, of and from the Univerſal Church, and from that precedent ſtanding they had there as branches and members of it. As the ſpecial muſt and doth agree with the general kind in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of it, or elſe it is no ſpecial of that general, as <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> ſpeak; So muſt a particular <hi>Church</hi> agree with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, in the univerſal nature of it, otherwiſe it is no particular of the Univerſal, but is ſomething of another kind. But now Baptiſm is ſo eſſentially, formally, and univerſally neceſſary to the viſible being, (I ſay viſible being) of the univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> and of every member of it, as that it is the diſtinguiſhing mark between thoſe that are, and thoſe that are not viſibly of it. For it is that mean, or only viſible door, by which viſibly men paſs out of the world, into the <hi>Church,</hi> from under the dominion of ſin and Satan, into the Rule and Government of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> That the Scriptures do aſſigne this office unto Baptiſm, I have formerly proved, as I ſuppoſe, and is the vote and conceſſion of all men generally, a few only excepted of thoſe that profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> If the Scriptures do in any other quarters of them repeal this mean, and ordain another in its ſtead, or do aſſigne any other beſides this to the ſame ſervice, I deſire to be directed therein that I may know what it is, and where I may find it; for I muſt profeſs my total ignorance of any ſuch thing, though I have made diligent ſearch for it. Nor is it indeed Gods way and method to leavy more means for the ſame end, when one is every way ſufficient; as I have formerly ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm then being ſo much of the general nature of the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> viſible being, as that no man can according to Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, eſteem any one duly and regularly a member thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; thoſe particular <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Church-members</hi> then, that partake not hereof, cannot in due form of Evangelical Law, nor according to the principles of reaſon, be eſteemed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Church-members</hi> of the univerſal, but either of ſome other kind, or at the beſt of an un-evangelical form and conſtitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This being Gods method, order, and way of bringing men into the enjoyment of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>viz.</hi> through the door of Baptiſm (as hath been already
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110914:62"/>obſerved) this very method, and order of his, ought to be very ſacred unto us, and inviolably obſerved by us. For as God <hi>is the God of order, and not of confuſion,</hi> ſo he hath commanded us to do all things; (<hi>viz.</hi> which he hath commanded in <hi>Church</hi>-Affairs,) <hi>decently and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Now what is it to do all things in order? but to do every thing in its due place, that firſt, which in order of inſtitution is firſt, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which hath a relative dependance upon that which goes before.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a beautiful harmony, and comely agreement between the wayes of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Ordinance and Ordinance, when each of them is obſerved in that order that is proper to them, in which reſpect I ſuppoſe, the Tabernacle or Houſe of God of old, was called, <hi>the Beauty of holineſs,</hi> or the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof, <hi>the comely honours of the Sanctuary,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> tenders it; which yet were <hi>but a pattern of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> i. e. Spiritual or Goſpel things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. and 8.5. The which ſpiritual beauty, being beheld by the Apoſtle in the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> he was much taken there with: <hi>Joying and beholding your order, &amp;c. Coloſſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>i.e.</hi> Joying to behold your order: which argues that this order of theirs was a lovely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs, it is a duty incumbent upon every one of them, who have devoted themſelves to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Affairs of his Goſpel, to endeavour as much as in them lies, the honour of their Maſter, and of the Affairs of his houſe: and therefore if there be any piece of comelineſs or beauty more in one way, then there is in another, (as doubleſs there is more in God's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method, then there is in that which is but of man) it will well become the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of that. The beſt way and method of doing the beſt things is to be coveted, as well as the beſt things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And as it is a thing very well pleaſing unto God, to have his own things done in his own way and order, ſo it is a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, to have his way and order neglected, and another introduced inſtead of it, yea, though ſuch a diſorder proceed from no wicked intent, out from inadvertancie only, <hi>The Lord
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110914:62"/>our God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>made a breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due order,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. meaning in that ſtroke upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> who did but touch the Ark, (out of an intent doubtleſs to uphold it upon the ſtumbling of the Oxen,) otherwiſe then Gods order was. And ſhall we think that the ſame Lord, <hi>who hath his eyes like a flame of fire,</hi> is not as jealous now for the due order of the Goſpel, as he was for the due order of the Law? And is there not the ſame reaſon to fear, that if any Church now ſhall tranſgreſs the Laws of his Houſe, that they alſo ſhall feel his hand in one kind or other, as well as they did in times paſt in like caſe? to the end. <hi>That all the Churches may know, that it is he that ſearcheth the reins, and the hearts, and that will give to every one according to his works: i.e.</hi> that they may know, that he is a narrow Obſerver of what is done in his Churches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p>Since then it was the Original Order of the Churches of Chriſt, in the midſt of whom Chriſt himſelfe walked, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch only to their Church-communion as had been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, (and that as we have reaſon to believe, according to what they had been taught by the Apoſtles, who did appoint them their order of doing, as well as the things they were to do, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and 11.2.) How does it concern ſuch as are ſtudious of reducing things in the Worſhip and Houſe of God to their primitive purity and beauty, to tread in their ſteps, and not to deviate there-from upon any pretence whatſoever.</p>
               <p>It is true, (as I obſerved before upon another occaſion) that it may ſo fall out, that in undertakings of reformation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ordinances and worſhip from under their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and decayes, there may be an impoſſibility, preciſely, and in all things, to anſwer the original uſage, but that through an indiſpenſible neceſſity, there will be in theſe reformers, ſome variation either in the Adminiſtrator, or in ſome conſiderable circumſtance of the adminiſtration; in reſpect of which indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible neceſſity, <hi>God accepts men according to what oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity they have, and not according to what they have not;</hi> when they proceed according to the Rule and Original pattern, to the utmoſt of their power and opportunity. But now in the caſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110914:63"/>in hand, no man amongſt us, is ſtaved off from a cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the original Order, by any abſolute and indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity, or for want of opportunity, there being a great variety of baptized Churches in theſe dayes, amongſt whom baptized perſons may caſt in their lot, and take out their portion of Chriſtian Fellowſhip, and Communion. So that where there is a mingling of perſons baptized, with ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized in Church-Fellowſhip now amongſt us, the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein from the ancient Goſpel-order, is not by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (which according to the Proverb hath no Law) but is meerly voluntary, and of choice, and therefore (ſo far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>I know indeed that ſuch things as theſe, ſeem but little in ſome good mens eyes, (I fear much leſs then of right they ought) who count men more nice then wiſe, who make a buſineſs of it to ſtand upon ſuch punctillioes. But be it ſo, that they are the leaſt of many among the things of the Goſpel, yet why ſhould they not have their ſhare of reſpect amongſt men according to what they be? What diſpenſation hath any man to deſpiſe or neglect the leaſt of the things or wayes of Chriſt Jeſus becauſe they are little? The <hi>Jots</hi> and <hi>Tittles</hi> of the Law (which were the leaſt things of it) were to have ſacred reſpect amongſt men, and to be obſerved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. And though <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy, and faith, were the weighty matters of the Law,</hi> and accordingly <hi>ought to have been done,</hi> yet <hi>the paying tythe of mint, anniſe, and cummin,</hi> which were the lighter matters of the Law, ought not to have been left undone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23.</p>
               <p>And was the tythe of herbs, the <hi>jots</hi> and <hi>tittles</hi> of the Law which came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be duly kept and obſerved? and ſhall any of the things of the Goſpel which came by Jeſus Chriſt, be neglected becauſe of their littleneſs? This is the praiſe of the faithful ſervant, that he is <hi>faithful in a very little. Luke</hi> 19.17. And it is the poſitive concluſion of Chriſt himſelf, who knows what is in man, and what are the principles of his actions; <hi>That he that it faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful alſo in much: and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much, Luke</hi> 16.10. And therefore it concerns every man that hath a deſire to approve himſelf a faithful ſervant in the account of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110914:63"/>Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, to make conſcience even of theſe things, Goſpel-order I mean, how little ſoever otherwiſe they ſeem to be in their eyes, whoſe ſight is ſo bad as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feeſmall objects, or elſe they ſo in-obſervant as that they overlook them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> We know that none were to be admitted into the Paſſover of old, but ſuch who had been firſt circumciſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And therefore if Baptiſm bear the like relation to the Supper of the Lord, as circumciſion did to the Paſſover, (which yet is a thing generally acknowledged by all,) then it follows, that as none uncircumciſed might be admited to the Paſſover, ſo none unbaptized may be admitted to the Supper of the Lord, and conſequently not to Church-communion whereof that is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I demand, according to what rule or principle of reaſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> judgment, or wiſdome, any man is to ſteer his courſe in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Affairs, in a way that is more dubious and dark, when he hath opportunity of proceeding therein upon terms of clear and certain ſatisfaction, and ſuch as are full of lights. In other caſes we ſuſpect them who <hi>wait for the twi-light, and unto whom the morning is as the ſhadow of death, as the Scripture ſpeaks, Job</hi> 20.15, 17. Whereas on the other ſide. <hi>He that doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs cometh to the light, John</hi> 3.21. And whether thoſe that decline a more lightſome and clear way, and chooſe that which is more obſcure and dark, may not reaſonably be ſuſpected to have ſome practiſe to promote which holds no communion with the light, I leave it to indifferent men to be conſidered. Doubtleſs it argues a diſtempered mind in a man, (that's the beſt you can make of it) when he chooſes uncouth wayes, and unknown for his journy, when he may have ſuch as are ſtraight, plain, and well known.</p>
               <p>But now that the joyning together of baptized perſons, with baptized in Church-communion, was practiſed in the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches, is a thing ſo evident and clear, that I think none will deny; but that it is as clear, that baptized and unbaptized perſons did in the Apoſtles times incorporate themſelves into Church bodies, I think none will affirm; however it will be found there is no reaſon ſo to do. And therefore now for any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110914:64"/>to chuſe rather to joyn themſelves in Church-communion with unbaptized perſons, when they have a fair opportunity of aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating themſelves therein, with ſuch as are baptized, is at the beſt to prefer uncertainty before certainty of Scripture-ground, in ſo weighty a buſineſs as is that of Church-Fellowſhip. And where there is any flaw in the evidence or ground upon which a man acts in matters of Religion, there will be a proportionable deduction of comfort and ſpiritual joy in the doing of the work; becauſe all the joy and comfort of any mans actions in Church-Affairs, (or indeed in any other) does ariſe and ſpring, partly from the knowledge he hath that it is a work of Gods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and partly from his confidence of his being accepted with God in the doing of it; the later of which takes not place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the former.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome will here object and ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> That though it do not lie ſo fair and clear in the Scriptures with that degree of evidence, that unbaptized perſons were admitted into Church-Fellowſhip with thoſe that were baptized, as it does appear that baptized ones held communion together, yet it does appear at leaſt upon probable grounds, that unbaptized perſons, were Church-members with thoſe that were baptized, in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> For when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his death?</hi> Do not theſe Particles of Speech, <hi>ſo many of us, and as many of you, as have been baptized,</hi> imply that there were ſome in, and of thoſe Churches that were not baptized into Chriſt? For the form of Speech, and manner of Phraſe, here uſed by the Apoſtle, is partitive, or diſtributive, and ſuppoſes the perſons of whom he ſpeaks, to be part of them baptized, and part of them unbaptized.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> That upon due conſideration had of the manner of ſpeaking, Scope of the Apoſtle, and the Collation of other Scriptures here with, it will appear, that no ſuch thing can be duly collected from the Scriptures mentioned, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Objection.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:110914:64"/>
               <p n="1">1. That though this form of ſpeaking, <hi>As many of you, and ſo many of us, &amp;c.</hi> is ſometime uſed in a partitive, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive ſence, and does denote a manifeſt difference between the perſons of whom the predication is made, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo uſed, nor does it alwayes import ſuch a thing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Let as many ſervants as are under the yoke, count their own Maſters worthy of all honour, that the Name of God, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be not blaſpemed.</hi> Here we ſee is the ſame form of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that mentioned in the Objection. But if we ſhould underſtand it in a partitive, or diſtributive ſence, then we muſt ſuppoſe, that ſome ſervants only were under the yoke of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that others were not; and alſo, that the Apoſtle would only have ſome ſervants; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were under the yoke, to count their Maſters worthy of all honour, but that he laid no ſuch injunction upon other ſervants, both which were abſurd to imagine. But the Apoſtles meaning, is, that all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for as much as they are under the yoke, ſhould exhibit all reſpects of honour to their Maſter, becoming ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And therefore in as much as this manner of expreſſion is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſometimes diſtributively, and ſometimes collectively, of all particulars to which it is applyed, that light by which we muſt know when it is uſed in the one ſence, and when in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt be had from the Context and Scope of the Sentence where we find it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore, I anſwer further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Scope of the Apoſtle being conſulted in the places mentioned in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it will evidently appear, that the inference made thence in the Objection, is altogether groundleſs and unreaſonable. For the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> thoſe words in <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>viz. For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> are alledged by him, as the reaſon of what he had ſaid before in that <hi>ver.</hi> 26. as hath been opened more at large upon another occaſion, in the former part of this Treatiſe. But now if their putting on of Chriſt in Baptiſm, was a proof of their relation to God as children, (as the Apoſtle you ſee makes it to be,) then that which he gives in by way of reaſon and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110914:65"/>proof, that they were all the children of God by faith, would fall very ſhort of this end, if only a part of the members of theſe Churches had been baptized, and not all. For though they who are baptized into Chriſt, and have thereby put on Chriſt, are thereby evidenced to be the children of God; yet how would it have followed, that they had been all the children of God by faith upon that account, when only but a part of them had been baptized? So that indeed, if you will underſtand this Scripture, as ſuppoſing ſome part only of theſe Churches to be baptized, and another part unbaptized, you force and faſten upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle a Soleciſm in reaſon, a groſs abſurdity, and piece of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculoſity in his way of reaſoning, as you will eaſily perceive, if you do but put the matter of his words ſo underſtood, into a Syllogiſm which then muſt run thus.</p>
               <p>If ſome of you only have been baptized into Chriſt, and have thereby put on Chriſt, then you are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. But ſome of you only have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Chriſt, and have thereby put on Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> you are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. To underſtand then the Apoſtle in ſuch a diſtributive ſence as that is for which the Objection pleads, is to deale by the Apoſtles argument and reaſon, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did by <hi>Davids</hi> Meſſengers, when he cut off their garments to their buttocks, and to render it altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to his Scope and purpoſe. Whereas to underſtand his <hi>as many of you, &amp;c.</hi> in a collective ſence for all the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and particular members of thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> is to render the Apoſtles argumentation comprehenſive of its end, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to its Scope, and as hitting the mark. For if their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized into Chriſt, was a proof of their Sonſhip to God, (in the ſence formerly declared) then he might well conclude them all, (and not ſome of them only) to be the children of God by faith in Chriſt, in as much they had been all baptized into Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The Scope of that place likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. will not admit of a diſtributive ſence of thoſe words, <hi>Know you not, that ſo many of us, as were baptized into Chriſt Jeſus, were baptized into his death?</hi> For the Apoſtles preſſing the great duty of Mortification upon this whole Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> he is to make
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:110914:65"/>his exhortation the more effectual, remembers them how they engaged themſelves to the practiſe thereof by their Baptiſm, upon which account he does enforce it upon them as you may perceive, if you carry your eye along from <hi>ver.</hi> 2. to the 13. So that you muſt ſuppoſe the Apoſtles ground or reaſon of his Exhortation, to be of as large an extent as his Exhortation it ſelf, otherwiſe you reflect diſparagement upon the wiſdom of the Apoſtle, that would uſe ſuch an Argument to perſwade the whole Church, which concerned only but a part of them. But now if you will ſuppoſe the Apoſtles foundation ſuitable to his building, and ſuch as would bear it; then you muſt conclude, that as the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is perſwaded to mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the account of their engagement thereunto in and by their Baptiſm, ſo alſo that the whole Church had formerly put themſelves under ſuch an engagement by their Baptiſm, and conſequently that the whole Church was baptized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, beſides all this, ſuch a ſuppoſition that theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did conſiſt partly of perſons unbaptized, as well as of thoſe that had been baptized, does croſs thoſe other Scriptures, by which we have proved that none doe duly in a viſible way enter into the univerſal Church, much leſs into a particular Church, which is ſubordinate thereunto, but by the door, or through the water of Baptiſm: The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that ſome are, but that <hi>all are baptized into one body, i.e.</hi> into one Church body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others they object further thus: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> That ſuch perſons as have repented, and do believe, and which are ſanctified, are fit matter whereof to make a Church, and accordingly are to be admitted into Church-Fellowſhip; for the Chriſtian Churches in the Apoſtles times, are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints, Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and ſometimes <hi>the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, Epheſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>and the faithful brethren in Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1.2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in as much as many of thoſe, who though they have not been baptized ſince they believed, yet being godly ſanctified perſons, and in that reſpect fit matter whereof to make Church-members, ought to be admitted into Church-Fellowſhip upon
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:110914:66"/>their deſire, their non-Baptiſm notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing of fitneſs in men to make Church-Members, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and of their right thereunto upon that fitneſs. There is a mediate and an immediate fitneſs in men for Church-Memberſhip (for though theſe words and phraſes are not found in the Scripture, yet we ſhall find the matter of this diſtinction there.)</p>
               <p>That which I call an immediate fitneſs, is ſuch a qualification, which does directly diſpoſe a man for, and render him regularly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of admiſſion into Church-fellowſhip, without any other thing intervening or coming between.</p>
               <p>That which I call a mediate fitneſs, is ſuch a qualification, by which a man is remotely and to a degree, (yea it may be in all degrees, one onely excepted) rendred capable of ſuch an admiſſion as that is of which we ſpeak; but yet ſo, that ſomething elſe, ſome other qualification then any yet he is inveſted with, muſt intervene, before he be regularly, compleatly, and according to Goſpel-order, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that admiſſion. According to this latter acceptation or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fitneſs, I do with all my heart acknowledg, that very many unbaptized perſons (as I count unbaptized) are fit to make Church Members, that is, they are ſo fit for it, that there wants nothing elſe to make them fit, but onely their Baptiſmal obedience, to wit, their ſubjection to that part of the Goſpel which requires them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus; unleſs it be the Impoſition of hands alſo with prayer in order to their receiving a greater preſence of the Spirit, which according to the Primitive practice, was wont to follow Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16, 17. and 19.5, 6. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.2. We may well ſuppoſe the perſons we ſpeak of, to be as fit for Church Communion, as thoſe converted Jews were, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and the Eunuch, the Jaylor, and others, were upon their repentance and belief, before they were baptized.</p>
               <p>But that they are immediatly fit for admiſsion into Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip by vertue of their repentance, faith, or ſanctification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm, is that which hath been, and is ſtill denied, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ruled caſe in Scripture to juſtifie ſuch an admiſsion. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the faith or holineſs of any man was before, yet his Baptiſm did ſtill precede his Church Memberſhip in the Primitive times, as hath been before declared. Let a man in all other reſpects ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110914:66"/>be as fit as fitneſs it ſelf can make him, to be the husband of ſuch or ſuch a woman, yet he may not enjoy her as a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys his wife, this his fitneſs notwithſtanding, untill the ſolemnities of Marriage are paſſed between them. In like manner may no man regularly and in due form of Goſpel proceeding be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Church-fellowſhip upon any account of fitneſs otherwiſe, if this fitting and preparatory qualification of Baptiſm be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in as much as God hath as well inſtituted Baptiſm as a means to bring men into viſible communion with the body of Chriſt which is his Church, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.) as he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted marriage as a fitting means to bring man and woman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that civil Communion which is proper onely to man and wife.</p>
               <p>And whereas thoſe Churches to which the Scripture quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned in the Objection relate, are deſcribed, not by their being baptized into Chriſt, but by their faith in him, and by their Sanctification or Saintſhip; I would to this ſay theſe three things briefly, by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they are not deſcribed by their being baptized, yet the perſons ſo deſcribed were baptized, as appears by other paſſages in thoſe very Epiſtles where the ſaid deſcriptions are, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 5. and 5.26. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they are ſaid to be ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, they are incluſively, or by way of implication ſaid to be baptized; as the mentioning an effect ſuppoſes its cauſe, ſo does their ſanctification ſuppoſe their being baptized; becauſe their Baptiſm was a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means of their ſanctification. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. The Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt giving himſelf for his Church, ſaith, he did it, <hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water (i.e.</hi> Baptiſm) <hi>by the Word:</hi> They Word and Baptiſm then, were two great Inſtruments of their Sanctification. And if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by their being ſanctified, their being ſeparated from the reſt of the world, and ſet apart or dedicated unto God (which moſt properly anſwers the notion of ſanctification) then their being ſaid to be ſanctifyed, may be underſtood in reſpect of their Baptiſm in ſpecial, though not that onely, becauſe by their Baptiſm they were viſibly put into a new condition, and into new relations, being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110914:67"/>thereby tranſmitted or carried over from the fellowſhip of the world, into the fellowſhip of Chriſt and of the Saints, and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet apart for the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reaſon why the Apoſtle deſcribes thoſe of the Churches aforeſaid, rather by their ſanctification, then by their being baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not (as may well be conceived) becauſe Baptiſm was not poſitively neceſſary as to their Church being, but becauſe ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was more comprehenſive of all particulars requiſite, not onely to their being a Church ſimply conſidered as ſuch, but alſo as unto the excellency of ſuch a being. For their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (the thing by which they are deſcribed) includes in it, both their Baptiſm, and all other parts and degrees of that qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by which they were, or might have been, eminently the Churches of God: Whereas Baptiſm being one of the principles or beginning Doctrines of Chriſt, and ſuch as which the Apoſtle leaves behind as it were, when he endeavours to advance the Hebrew Church to higher perfections (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3.) if the Apoſtle had deſcribed them by this, his deſcription of them would have fallen beneath their qualifications, they having now made ſome progreſs in Chriſtianity when thoſe Epiſtles were written to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things then conſidered, the Apoſtle his deſcribing the Churches to whom he wrote, by ſuch qualifications wherein Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not particularly mentioned, will not miniſter any ground of making Church Members of ſuch who are not baptized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> Another Objection (and indeed all that I know further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable) is this: The Apoſtles exhortation to the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> was, that they would receive ſuch as were but weak in the faith, to wit, ſuch as erroniouſly held it neceſſary to abſtain from ſuch meats which in themſelves were indifferent and lawfull to be uſed, <hi>Rom,</hi> 14.1, 2. and if their weakneſs in the faith, or error in their knowledg hereabout, was no ſufficient bar againſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into Church fellowſhip, then why ſhould a like error and weakneſs in men now about Baptiſm be counted a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and juſt impediment to their admiſsion into Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> ſeveral things may be conſidered, by which gradually we may come to a clear reſolution and full ſatisfaction in the Caſe, as touching the invalidity of this Objection. As,</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:110914:67"/>
               <p n="1">1. That as on the one hand, it is not every weakneſs in faith, or errour in knowledge about the things of the Goſpel, that does exclude a man from <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> as appears by the Scripture now mentioned in the Objection; ſo on the other hand, it is not every profeſſion of the faith neither which men make, that does render them duly capable of it. For then the worſt of men, if but making any kind of profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, ſhould be admittable into the Communion of Saints, which yet is a thing altogether diſſonant unto the Laws of <hi>Church-communion.</hi> Some errours then muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in ſome men profeſſing the Goſpel, which do juſtly debar them from <hi>Church-communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This being granted, in the next place, to the end men may be upon terms of certainty, is to know what errours they be, which do <hi>de jure</hi> exclude men from <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> and what do not; recourſe muſt be had to ſome fixed ſtanding rule, by which to make a right judgment in the caſe; otherwiſe men will but rove at random, and be in danger of making ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours excluſive of mens <hi>Church</hi>-memberſhip which are not, as likewiſe of making the door of this admiſſion wider then God hath made it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That then which muſt be the ſtandard, by and according to which to make a right judgment in the caſe, muſt be that thing what ever it be, which is appointed by God as the next and immediate means appropriately of mens viſible union with the <hi>Church:</hi> and the reaſon hereof, is, becauſe as on the one hand, leſs then a mans coming up to that mean what ever it be, which is the immediate inlet into the <hi>Church,</hi> cannot miniſter either a right or opportunity of his being of the <hi>Church;</hi> ſo on the other hand, nothing more then this can be duly inſiſted on as abſolutely neceſſary to make a man capable thereof: and therefore who ever attains thereto, cannot upon any account of infirmities otherwiſe, be juſtly debarred his communion with the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That thing then which is the appropriate and immediate means of a mans viſible entrance into, and union with the Church, is Baptiſm, it being as the Bridge over which, or as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:110914:68"/>the Gate through which men declaredly paſs over from the friendſhip of the world, into the fellowſhip of the Saints: this hath formerly been proved, and therefore needs not here to be repeated. It is true indeed, Baptiſm is properly the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate means of admiſſion into the univerſal Church, but whoever is by it duly made a member of the univerſal Church, hath thereby a right of admiſſion into a particular Church, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore in the laſt place; If Baptiſm duly adminiſtred and received, or mens coming up to the laws and terms of its due adminiſtration, be the ſtandard according to which men are to be judged meet, or unmeet for Church-communion, then it follows, that whatever errours or infirmities are in men, yet if they be not of that nature as to detain them from imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Baptiſm on Scripture terms, thoſe errours do not, cannot juſtly debar them of Communion with the <hi>Church;</hi> and on the other hand, whatever other quallification there is in men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſpoſing and fitting of them for <hi>Church communion,</hi> yet if they be under the power and command of any ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which cauſes them to refuſe baptiſm upon thoſe terms, according to which, upon Scripture account it ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and ſo cauſes them to fall ſhort of the formall and immediate mean of their regular union, and viſible conjunction with the <hi>Church,</hi> that errour does neceſſarily deprive them both of right and opportunity of being of the <hi>Church</hi> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>Theſe things then being duly conſidered, we may eaſily come to a reſolution about the two Caſes mentioned in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether this errour about Baptiſm, of which we ſpeak, does no more deprive men of a right of admiſſion into <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> then that weakneſs in the faith did of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks. For that error about abſtaining from meats (which is the weakneſs in the faith, of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaks) being an errour of that nature only, which did not keep them that were under it from cloſing with Baptiſm as the means of their union with the Church, (I mean, upon thoſe terms according to which God had authorized the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110914:68"/>and reception of it,) but that they might, and did repent and believe the main Principles of the Goſpel, (the terms quallifying men for Baptiſm,) and did thereupon receive Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for all this weakneſs of theirs: Hence it came to paſs, that they were to be admitted into <hi>Church-communion,</hi> this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs notwithſtanding. But now their errour about Baptiſm of whom we ſpeak, being an errour of that nature, by which they are kept off from imbracing Baptiſm upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture terms, and ſo of attaining to, and making uſe of that which is the appropriate mean of their viſible union with the <hi>Church,</hi> this errour of theirs does in a direct way unavoidably cut them ſhort both of right and opportunity of a regular admiſſion into <hi>Church-Fellowſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being then ſo broad a difference between the two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours compared in the Objection, as you ſee there is; the one conſiſting with, the other being repugnant to that very mean, without which a viſible conjunction and union with the Church is not attainable on Scripture terms, it therefore no wiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that becauſe the one was no juſt impediment unto mens <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> that therefore the other is not neither; for where things and caſes do really differ as theſe do, there the conſequences of thoſe things cannot be the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſhed my Anſwers to theſe Objections, I ſuppoſe it doth appear by what hath been offered to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this behalf, theſe Objections notwithſtanding, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptized, refuſing to joyn themſelves in Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thoſe who are unbaptized, is not without ſuch grounds which will render them approved in ſo doing.</p>
